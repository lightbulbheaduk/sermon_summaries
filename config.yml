# How to find the channel ID for a YouTube channel (if the channel uses the
# newer handle format like youtube.com/@channelname):
# 1. Open the channel page in your browser (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/@channelname).
# 2. Click the "About" tab (or the three-dot / "More" button) on the channel page.
# 3. In the modal that appears click the "Share" button and choose "Copy channel ID".
# 4. The channel ID will be in the form `UC...` (starts with UC). Use that value in the
#    RSS feed URL below, e.g.:
#      https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
