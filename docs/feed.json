    "transcript": "Good evening, everybody. So if you don't know, I teach here at a theological college, and before we moved here, I guess two and a half years ago, I taught at a university in Houston. And the last module that I taught that spring, I guess, is what it was, was called The Good Life and Happiness. It was, we drew it off, stole it, I guess, as you do in academics all the time, is plagiarized from other academics. And there is a module at Yale that is oversubscribed every year that they've run it of a similar title, because everybody is looking how to have a good life, one of meaning and purpose, one of, yeah, just fullness in that sense. And so in that way then, we were after this to help lead students in that. And it reminded me as we come here in the new year, I think we're officially in like the normal part of the new year, and so that means all of our New Year's resolutions, right, maybe have fallen away or haven't. But if you think about this, these resolutions are a little step each year to think, like, how do I make my life a little bit more like I thought it should be or I wanted it to be? And so we're after that good life ourselves. And so as a way to help us think about this, I'm going to set you to chatting with your neighbors. So you should already know most people's names around you, right? So, but if you don't, say hello and introduce yourself again. But we'll just have this quick question here for you to think about with one another. What New Year's resolutions do you have or do you not have? And or, if you don't have one, are there ones in the past that maybe have stuck out to you? So take about a minute and a half to chat with one another. All right, so we'll take some time over tea and toast for you to share those other ones with one another. But really raises this issue. A lot of people won't make New Year's resolutions anymore because they're a bit cynical about the possibility of change in that sense. And we've become a bit satisfied or at least cynical about where we are. And the passage that we're going to talk about today talks about truly achieving or experiencing aspects of this good life that God promises us. And so the whole question then is that do we actually dare to even hope for the possibility of change? Can we envision it? Do we expect that God might actually show up and bring change to broken situations? And so our passage today is where we're going to talk about that. We're talking about a good life. And particularly, we're talking about the good news here. So this season of the year, we always teach through one of Jesus' biographies. So this year we're teaching through the Gospel of Luke, the biography of Luke. And these biographies are titled a gospel, which is just the old English word for good news. And so as we read and hear this story that there's the best news that's ever been shared. And that means that it's not just good news, a story about Jesus, but actually good news for us in that sense that we can experience some goodness here and not just a hope for the future, but one that we can actually experience today. So our passage is from Luke chapter four. I'm going to read from Luke 4, 16 to 21 to help us hear what this good news is. So Jesus returned from Galilee in the power of the Spirit. And the news about him spread through the whole countryside. He was teaching in their synagogues and everyone praised him. He went to Nazareth where he had been brought up. And on the Sabbath day, he went into the synagogue as was his custom. He stood up to read and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it was written, the Spirit of the Lord is on me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. And he began by saying to them, today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing. This is a story about good news that Jesus is bringing. It's not just a story about good news for Jesus himself, but for us. As we hear, it's today back at his time it was fulfilled. And so if it was true then, it's still true today. Importantly here, Jesus is quoting from Isaiah 61. And so this news is not new news at this time. Actually, it's old news. It's news that was given to the people of Israel beforehand. And so before we talk about this passage and understand it, it's better. We need to take a step back in time about 700 years to think about Isaiah's time and the message that this came from originally. So in the Old Testament at this point, the Jews had turned away from God, that they were experiencing his correction. And so they had gone off into exile. So they were in, instead of living in the land of Israel, the land of Canaan, they had been sent over to the land of Assyria. And it's in the midst of this separation from God, from his promises, that God gives them this promised hope for a future. And he particularly says, this hope for the future, this restoration from this sin and exile, is going to come through a king, a Messiah, one who is coming in the power of the Spirit. And so as a way to help us understand and grasp this, we're going to read a couple of passages here. So I've given somebody Isaiah 11. I can't remember who has which. And so we're going to have these read out. It's very small on the screen, but you will listen closely here, I'm sure. Isaiah 11, verse 1 to 5. A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse. From his roots a branch will bear fruit. The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him, the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of knowledge and fear of the Lord. And he will delight in the fear of the Lord. He will not judge by what he sees with his eyes or decide by what he hears with his ears. But with righteousness he will judge the needy. With justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth. With the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked. Righteousness will be his belt, faithfulness the sash around his waist. Thanks, yeah. So we see the root of Jesse. So Jesse is David's father. And so this is a promise that someone in the line of David, the king of Israel, will come in the power of the Spirit. Who's Isaiah 42? Yep, okay. Isaiah 42, verse 1 to 7. Here is my servant, who I am upheld, my chosen one whom I delight. I'll put my spirit on him and he will bring justice to the nations. He will not shout or cry out or raise his voice in the streets. A bruised reed will not break and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out. In faithfulness he will bring forth justice. He will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his teaching the islands will put their hope. This is what God the Lord says, the creator of the heavens, who stretches out, who spreads out to the earth with all the spring from it, who gives breath to its people and life to those who walk on it. I, the Lord, have called you righteousness. I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and I will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for the Gentiles to open eyes that are blind, to free captives from poison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness. So we see this king is going to come and bring and rule in righteousness. He's going to bring justice. In that sense, he's going to make right what had been wrong. And this is where we get to our passage in Isaiah as well that Jesus quotes. This passage that the spirit of the Lord is upon me. So, and he's upon me because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor, recovery of sight to the blind and liberation for the oppressed. And so there's this hope. But we see that it was, if you remember, 700 years from the time of Isaiah until Jesus. And so like us, maybe they had become a little bit cynical. Like dared they even to hope for the possibility of change. And so they are in this place of waiting. And it's this waiting that we celebrate actually in the season of Advent. That's Advent is when we're waiting for the king to come, right? And so at Christmas then we celebrate this story of Jesus. And what do we see in Luke here is the very thing that Isaiah is talking about. Not just this one bit here, but the whole idea that Jesus is the Messiah, the Davidic king who is coming in the power of the Spirit. And so it's not just a story in Isaiah. We're encountering Isaiah 42, Isaiah 61, Psalm 2.\n\nthis and Jesus himself here. And so as a way to get a picture of this story, we have some other passages here from Luke. So we're going to have three readings here. So someone from Luke chapter 1. This is a vision that Mary is going to receive. Luke 1 verse 30. But the angel said to her, do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. You will conceive and give birth to a son and you are to call him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever. His kingdom will never end. How will this be, Mary asked the angel, since I am a virgin? The angel answered, the Holy Spirit will come on you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God. So again, Jesus is coming in the power of the Spirit. And then Luke chapter 3. The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah. John answered them all, I baptize you with water, but one who is more powerful than I will come. The straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, you are my son whom I love, with you I am well pleased. So again, Jesus is the one who is coming in the power of the Spirit. And so Luke is trying to reiterate this. In fact, by the time we get to chapter 4, we have this summary. Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness where for 40 days he was tempted by the devil. Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit and news about him spread through the whole countryside. So Jesus is full of the Spirit. He's in the power of the Spirit. He's led by the Spirit. And so then we show up to this passage here where he quotes this Isaiah passage where he says, the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news for the poor. And so he is this Davidic king, this Messiah who is coming in the power of the Spirit to bring restoration to the world. And importantly, though, this isn't just good news about Jesus. It's the good news about how we participate in that even here today because the Spirit is here. So as we think about the nature of this kingdom that Jesus is speaking about, we need to think about Jesus as the Messiah first and then the nature of the kingdom. As we come to the idea that Jesus quotes this, he says, the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. But actually, we might better say that he has Messiahed me or he has Christed me. The word Messiah means anointed one. And so when he says the Spirit of the Lord is upon me to anoint me, we see the disconnect there. But the word there christened actually is the word that we get from this that you put a little bit of oil on a baby's head when they're baptized. They're made little Christ. They're anointed ones as well as Christ. And so this helps us to remember if you were here last year, you heard me say this before, but I think it's very helpful to remind ourselves. It's not Joseph and Mary Christ that had little baby Jesus Christ. Christ is not his name. It's a title. He is the Christ. That's just the Greek word for anointed one. The Hebrew word for anointed one is Messiah. So it's good that we call him Jesus the Messiah. So when he's saying this, the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he Messiahed me to preach good news to the poor. So it's the presence of the Spirit on Jesus that actually makes him the Messiah, this Davidic King that was promised to come in the power of the Spirit. And so in that sense, he's fulfilling these promises here. But the important thing that we see here is that it's not just a story about him being the king. It's that the king then is bringing in the kingdom. And that's where we see the rest of this passage, that it's good news to the poor, recovery of sight to the blind, to set the prisoners free. And then he ends with this idea of the year of the Lord's favor, the idea of jubilee. And all of these things are just different ways to talk about things that have gone wrong, whether they're physical, social, communal, economic, even, is that the Messiah is going to come and bring justice, bring, make things right that were wrong. And this is the salvation that he says is here today. And of course, the rest of Jesus' ministry that we'll see after this is him playing this out. He casts out demons from people. He heals the blind. He even raises the dead. He brings forgiveness to those who have sinned. And so his restoration is holistic. Oftentimes we think about salvation as what I call cosmic fire insurance. You get saved, right? You believe in Jesus and it's going to make sure that you get to go to the good place in the end. But what happens between when you believe and then is kind of like what I call white knuckle faith. It's like I'm just going to white knuckle it until the end because I really don't expect things to change because the whole idea is just that I get to go to that place then. But Jesus' whole story here, his good news, his gospel is that God actually shows up today, here and now, through the power of his spirit to bring transformation. It's not always going to look the same way, right? The blind person needs sight, right? The one who is a prisoner needs liberation. That's going to look different. And so the Spirit and Jesus is going to show up differently in each one of our lives. And in fact, I'm going to give you a second here to chat with one another. Is there a story of when you've experienced God in a way that seems to been out of the ordinary, that God has broken in to bring transformation to your life and experience? So the question is, have you ever experienced the good news in this way, particularly like in signs and wonders? So I'll give you a couple minutes for somebody to share with one another in your groups. Sometimes we encounter things, we see God show up in situations, and then other situations we pray for for years and don't see God working. And so sometimes we're like those, the Jewish people who had been given this promise, and yet it's been hundreds of years since the promise and they're wondering that. In fact, it's been now 2,000 years from the time that Jesus gave this sermon until today. And so sometimes we lose our sense of hope and we're back to that same question. Do we dare even to hope for the change and possibility that we might be let down? Can we actually encounter the reality of the kingdom today is the question that's before us. And one of the reasons that people think that this doesn't really show up is because it's only for the super Christians to get to pray for. That's another sermon. So you've got Luke 9 and Luke 10 is where Jesus draws in the disciples of the 12. But then the 72, these are all the everyday regular Christians were praying and he sent them to go out and proclaim the kingdom of God and pray for healing and restoration. And so it's not just for the super Christians. Oftentimes, too, we think that our problems are too mundane. Like I don't have blindness, right? I'm not in prison. This kind of restoration that Jesus is talking about, these signs and wonders are too big. And so I can't really expect to see the kingdom in my life. It actually brings up this story to me of a time in my life that I saw God at work in a supernatural way. You may not have known this, but I used to visit, there's a picture here, used to visit this brothel here. It's a foot massage parlor a couple of times a month. It wasn't for services, but we were in outreach and ministry to the women there. Because as you will likely know that most of the women in places like this are human trafficked. And so we were partnering with a ministry there in Houston that actually had an adopt a brothel program for churches. And so we would go and minister to the women there. And all we would do is once or twice a month, show up for about five minutes, maybe 10 if it was a long visit. The very first time we went, the woman who was being trafficked herself was very clearly nervous that we were going to cause problems for her. And she's like, this is a place of business. We don't want you doing these kinds of things here. And all we would do is come and bring gifts to the women and then offer to pray for them. So very simple. And I saw God's work there. In fact, this place is still doing the same things. It's still, they weren't released. We didn't see this grand transformation. But almost to a year to the date, we were going to this brothel.\n\nSo the same woman greeted us. We didn't see the same ones every time. And it was Chinese New Year, and this time we just brought, they were all women from China, so we brought little gifts that you would give that would be normal things to give as Chinese New Year's gifts. And instead of pushing us out the door and running us off, she went around and hugged each one of us and said, I just feel so loved. And it was like, we're bringing really cheap things to give to you. And yet God's Spirit broke in and did something supernatural in her heart. And so our problems are never too mundane for the kingdom to show up. The power of the Spirit is always greater than the power of the sin that is within us and the situations we're in. And we may not see the fullness of the kingdom here, in fact, until Jesus returns. But we keep this hope alive and we pray with the reality of expectation that God's good news is good news for us today, because that Spirit that we have, the Spirit that we hope and see brings the fruit of the Spirit, of love and joy and peace. The Spirit that gives us spiritual gifts of teaching and encouragement. And prophetic words is also the Spirit that is at work that Jesus has proclaimed here that brings healing and restoration to broken people. And so it's this good news that we actually have the hope to participate in. And so I'm going to pray for us and we'll have a time here to pray with one another as well. So Father, we pray that you would come, Holy Spirit, come in this place and let us experience your healing and restoration. Wherever our brokenness is, come and bring life. In Jesus, our Messiah's name. Amen."

    "transcript": "Okay, marvellous. Quick show of hands. Who this week has returned to something? Returned to work, returned to school, returned to some kind of responsibility? How's it been? Show me a thumb. Thumbs up was, it's great. Thumbs down meant, it's not very happy right now. Okay, that's a pretty good smattering around the room. Personally, for me, the hardest thing about this week has been getting out of bed. Is there nobody else? I expected there to be a little, but no, there was nothing. So personally, for me, one of the things that's been hardest about this week is getting out of bed. Still nothing. Okay, this is gonna be one of those Sundays. Honestly, what the heck is wrong with this week? Like two weeks of Christmas, sleep as long as you like-ish. And then honestly, Monday morning was like being dunked into an ice bath. Who was with me? It was quite something, right? It was quite something. Any morning people in the room? Morning people? Yes. How? How do you do it? I know you are. I mean, yeah, I don't think I could cope with that. Honestly, I would give anything to be a morning person. I just admire you big time. For those normal people in the room who struggle to get out of bed, what is it that motivates you to get up and out of bed? Like what is it the thing that impels you up? Because especially this week, it's been really cold, hasn't it? And I'm like, I don't want to get out of my bed because it's so cold. I mean, you live on a barge, so you know what I'm talking about. Like it's so unbelievably cold out there. I don't want to get out of bed. So I've been thinking a little bit about motivation this last week, especially because it's the first proper week of the new year. And I know that's a bit cheesy, but some people are thinking about new year's resolutions. And I think if you're going to get through new year's resolutions, you need two things. One of them is motivation, decent motivation to get up and get on with it. And the second thing is you need sustenance. You need something that's going to kind of impel you through when it becomes difficult and boring. I think you need motivation and sustenance. So those two things are on my mind. So what I want you guys to do is turn to those people around you, make sure everybody's included, and just ask the question, what are the things that motivate you to get through life? And what's the things that sustain you through life? So what are the things that kind of get you up in the morning, get you going, that kind of help you to go and see and go and do something big and scary? And what are the things that motivate you through when it gets a bit tough and a bit boring? Find those people around you. You've got literally 60 seconds, and then I want to hear from you. So what motivates you? What sustains you? Five, four, three, two, one. Okay, I want to hear. What are the things that motivate you and what are the things that sustain you? Go on. The mild peril of my child being late for school. The mild peril of your... That's very good. That's very real. Okay, what else? Yes. Coffee. Yes. Who's with me? Yes, coffee. Very good. Anybody else? What else? Yes, your hand remains up. Not getting fired. Yes, absolutely. I was thinking this this week, like, can I put duty down? Like, is duty a thing? I think it is. Anybody else? Come on, let's have a handful more. Our group said food. Yes, absolutely. I mean, obviously food sustains you through the day. And motivates. And motivates. You're like, I've got some good food waiting at the end of the day. I've got to get through this. Absolutely. Anybody else think like that? Yeah, okay. Anybody else? Let's have like two more. Two more. Yes. My sister. Okay, explain. Motivates or sustains? Both. I'm confused. What do you mean? She helps me a lot. Is it that she just has so much natural momentum that you just get pulled along in her wake? Or am I overthinking it? Overthinking. Okay, I'm overthinking it. One more. Let's have one more. Yes. See my twins in the morning. Say again. See my twins in the morning. Twins in the morning. Okay, so it's just you're so excited to see one another. It's just the sweetest thing I've heard all day. That's very cute. Okay. Jesus, thank you. Jesus motivates us. That is... of course. So, this idea, being motivated, being sustained, my question here, if you would kind of group those two ideas together into one word, I think my question would be, what is it that powers you? What powers you? This microphone is powered by batteries. What is it that powers you? What is it that fuels you? What is it that gets you started? What keeps... I mean, are you gonna share it with the whole class? I'm desperate to know. What is it that helps you to be all that you can be? It helps you to finish what you started. What is it that motivates you through the boring stuff and what inspires you to get back up when you get knocked down? Like, what things power you? Like the big stuff and the small stuff. The coffee and the commitment, the vision and the vegetables. What is it that powers you? This term we're gonna be thinking about what powers us. Or rather, we're gonna be thinking about who empowers us. We're gonna be talking not about caffeine or Weetabix to get us through the day. We're not even gonna be talking about having vision or optimism for our lives to get us going. No, instead, we're gonna be exploring how our Bibles tell us that we are empowered by the Holy Spirit. I've got a nifty little definition of what it means to be empowered here. It says being given the ability, the authority, or the strength to act effectively, especially beyond one's own natural capacity. So this term, our theme, the thing we're gonna be exploring every week, is the idea of being empowered by the Spirit, exploring the ways that we are called as human beings to live a life to all of its fullness by being filled and empowered by the Holy Spirit. And before we go any further, I want to issue an invitation. And if you've been to Gloucester Vineyard Church, if you've been part of our church for more than a year, you probably know what I'm about to say. Because we do this every single year as part of our annual rhythms. What we do is at the beginning of the year between Christmas and Easter, we always read one of the biographies of Jesus' life. There are four at the beginning of our New Testaments, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And what we do is we take a whole term to read a whole biography together as a whole church. So the rhythm is that on the week before, in the weekly email, we'll send out a handful of chapters. So who read chapters 1 and 2 last week? Oh, guys, you're all behind. You're all behind. It's okay, don't worry, don't worry. So each week, we're gonna read two chapters or two or three chapters from the Gospel according to Luke. And then on the Sunday, one of our preaching team will unpack that. And then in the following week, in our home groups, there'll be an opportunity to go a little bit deeper in discussion groups. And so what we end up doing is we get to really go deep on a biography. We get to hear Jesus in his own words, all the bits we agree with, all the bits we disagree with. And we get to meet him and hopefully wrestle with him, argue with him, disagree with him, and hopefully get to a place where we want to follow him. That's the plan. We do it every year. And I think it's still bearing fruit. And so we're doing it again. Who's with me? Yes, come on. So we're gonna be reading through the Gospel. Oh, and the really exciting thing is that Kids Church does it too. So when the kiddos come back in in a minute, they're doing Luke 1 and 2 today. It's so good. So I love that about it, that Heather writes something that goes alongside as well. It's very exciting. So why are we reading Luke? Why Luke this term? There's a couple of reasons. Firstly, because in the book of Luke, there are so many references to the Holy Spirit. So when we're talking about being empowered by the Holy Spirit, there are so many stories in the book of Luke of people who were empowered by the Holy Spirit to do amazing things. The second reason is because as a church, we are getting ready for a moment of multiplication. In about 30, no, not 30, about 90-ish days, three months' time, we're gonna be launching a new expression of this church up in Innsworth. And frankly, that's gonna take more from us than we have to give. That's something that we can only achieve if we are truly empowered by the Holy Spirit. And so I thought it'd be a good idea to kind of look at that this term. And finally, because we believe as a church that this is actually what it means to be fully human and fully alive, to be full of the Holy Spirit and empowered by him to be everything that we can be. So that's it. Who's ready? Who wants to dive in? Excellent. Three of you do. Well, we're gonna go in anyway. Okay, so before we go any further, I've got a quick\n\ndo things, but really, without me, you can do nothing. I think that's a legitimate way of reading that, right? It could be saying that. Or Jesus might be saying that we simply can do nothing without him. We just can't do anything without him. No breathing, no walking, no speaking, no looking. We can't do anything without Jesus. And you can come and disagree with me later, but I think that when we... I think what we discover is that actually our Bibles are encouraging us to adopt a worldview where the latter is how we're supposed to think. That actually, without Jesus, without his power and his sustenance, we can do nothing. When we open our Bibles, when we look at the very first page, we read, it says, in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, everything up there and everything down here. The earth was formless and empty, and the darkness covered the deep, and the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, hovered over the surface of the waters. And then, just in the next chapter, in chapter 2, we read, then God formed the man from the dust of the ground, and he breathed, breathed breath into the man's nostrils, and the man became a living person. And this idea of the breath of God kind of giving life to humanity, it's not left in Genesis, it carries on through the rest of our Bibles. If you go into Psalm 104, you read this beautiful poem about all of creation. It says, O Lord, the variety of things that you've made, and it lists like antelopes and anteaters and things. And then it says, but if you turn away from them, they panic. When you take away their breath, they die and turn to dust. When you give them your breath, life is created, and you renew the face of the earth. We're encouraged to imagine God giving his breath to all of creation, that actually that breath is what is sustaining everything on the planet that lives, including you and me. And this idea doesn't just live in our Old Testament, it lives in the second part of our Bible as well, called the New Testament. When we read the book of Acts, there's a guy called Paul, and he's giving a big speech, and he basically says, Jesus, he gives life and breath to everything, and he satisfies every need. He goes on to say, for in him we live and move and have our being. What emerges when we pick up our Bibles is this kind of picture, this idea, that it is God who breathes his life into us, and that all of the life that we experience, our consciousness, our breath, our pulse, it comes from him. It is a gift from him. All life is given by God, all life is sustained by God, all life is motivated by God. Now in the beginning of the church, there was a whole bunch of stuff going on, and lots of people had lots of interesting ideas about what was true. And so some very clever people decided to lay down some kind of guidelines of what was biblical truth and what wasn't. They made these things called creeds. They made a handful of them, but one of the most famous ones was one called the Nicene Creed. And there's a line in there that when the Holy Spirit gets introduced, it says, We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life. It's like that's the Holy Spirit's job description, the giver of life. It's a little bit like this. Here we go. Here we have a toy car. And as you can see, it can do nothing. If I put that there, it could do nothing. There it is. But if I breathe into this... Thank you. If I put my breath in this... This thing is now empowered by my breath. Shall we find out what happens? And so now when I put it on the floor and release it, it kind of falls on its side and flaps around and crashes into a chair. I mean, who hasn't had a day like that, right? Is that not a picture of our everyday lives that, you know, we tend to just flap around and it didn't work. But there we go. But that's the idea, that without Jesus, we can do nothing. He is the very empowering breath in our lungs. You can disagree with me if you like, but you're wrong. And it makes me think, it makes me think about that thing that Jesus said. He said, without me, you can do nothing. And maybe that's true. Maybe without the presence of the Holy Spirit propping us up and motivating us through the world, we can do nothing. I think it's an amazing thing to think about. But we're not just motivated and sustained by the Holy Spirit. When we open the book of Luke, we read a narrative and it encourages us to believe that we are empowered by the Holy Spirit as well. Remember that definition of empowered that we touched on earlier on, being giving the ability, the authority or the strength to act effectively, especially beyond one's natural ability. So this term in Luke, we're going to be exploring the ways the Holy Spirit empowers us, giving us the ability, the authority and the strength to act, especially beyond our natural capacity. If you do get a chance this week, there will be other chapters to read. But if you do go back, I really encourage you, open your Bibles, get a highlighter pen, read chapters 1 and 2 and highlight every time the Holy Spirit shows up and empowers somebody to do something. It's loads. It happens a lot. We see a guy called John the Baptist who is filled with the Holy Spirit in his mother's womb. And his mother is a woman called Elizabeth. And we read about the Holy Spirit enables her to recognize Jesus in Mary's womb and it enables Mary to prophesy over, sorry, Elizabeth to prophesy over Mary. And we read about three prophets. We read about Zechariah, Simeon and Anna, three people who are empowered by the Spirit to speak God's truth into a situation and prophesy. It's amazing. It's amazing stuff. Do go and do it. But to kind of land what we're going to be talking about today, I want to highlight something else. I want to highlight the Holy Spirit's encounter with Mary. Now, we may have just heard this if we engaged with any Christmas stuff in church over the last month or so. But I want to look at that moment when the angel comes to Mary and kind of speaks to her and commissions her. And so we're going to read that little bit. I'd love to have a volunteer. Would somebody like to volunteer to read real quick? Anybody? It's not a trick. Yeah, come on up. That's great. Please and thank you. If you wouldn't mind just reading this. There's a microphone. I'm going to be doing something at the same time, but don't worry. It's not distracting in the slightest. Shall I stand to the side? No, it's fine. Nobody will. Okay. In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a village in Galilee, to a virgin named Mary. She was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of King David. Gabriel appeared to her and said, Greetings, favored woman. The Lord is with you. Confused and disturbed, Mary tried to think what the angel could mean. Don't be afraid, Mary, the angel told her, for you have found favor with God. You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus. He will be very great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David, and he will reign over Israel forever. His kingdom will never end. Mary asked the angel, But how can this happen? I am a virgin. The angel replied, The Holy Spirit will hover over you and rest upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the baby to be born will be holy and he will be called the Son of God. Mary responded, I am the Lord's servant. May everything you have said about me come true. And then the angel left her. Marvelous. Thank you, Aaron. Usually when people come and read, they get chocolate. And today's no exception. Thank you. Come on. If you hear any rattling. Yes, see, you could have had chocolate. You don't know what you've missed out on. Also, what a pro. Stone cold pro whilst I'm blowing this up behind him. Thank you, Aaron. Yeah, great. So who's heard that recently? Anybody? Did you hear that this year? Yeah, yeah. So it's a very familiar, familiar little passage. A couple of things jumped out to me. There's some, if you know your Bibles, you might have noticed that there was a little bit of language that was a little bit different there to what Aaron read. It said what you might have heard growing up. He said that the Holy Spirit hovered over Mary and rested upon her and the presence of the Lord overshadowed her. And that's because as I was kind of looking into this this week, I kind of suddenly think, started to think about that passage right at the beginning of our Bibles, which says that in the very beginning, the spirit of God hovered over the empty waters, over the darkness. And it's like that spirit being there right at the beginning before the first act of creation. It's like the Holy Spirit shows up again for another act of creation, not just giving life to a human, but actually initiating a new creation. And I looked into it and I'm not the only one who thought that. So it's OK. That's not heresy. We're OK. There's an echo from the first pages of our Bibles into the first chapter of Luke when the Holy Spirit shows\n\nWhen we get empowered by the Holy Spirit, this happens. So previously, when I let the car off, it did three spins and then crashed into a chair. But what we read about when, you know, we're designed to be full of the Holy Spirit, but we're, it's up to us whether we want to be empowered by the Holy Spirit. Amen? And so here we have a car that is empowered by quite a bit more than the previous one. Shall we find out what happens when this one gets let go? Look at it go! Yeah! I mean, that went way better than I thought it would. Sorry about that. Crashing over there. I thought what was gonna happen was that the balloon was gonna disappear and the car was gonna tumble. And then it's like, oh no, the Holy Spirit doesn't abandon us. No! But it didn't! So it's great. It's wonderful. We are all designed to be, thank you Hannah, we're all designed to be like Mary, to partner with God, to be more than we could ever be on our own, to do more than we could ever do on our own. Not just so that we can have a nice, comfortable life, but that God's work and his purposes and his kingdom can come and be worked out through our lives. Do you notice how God waited for Mary to say yes to being empowered? Did you notice that? Like, do you notice how he kind of told her what he wanted to do and he gave her an opportunity to ask his questions, ask her questions, to express her doubts? How kind is God in this moment? I want you to think about your next week. Just take a moment to just picture where are you going to spend the majority of your week next week? Who are the people that you will spend the majority of your time with next week? What are the things on your to-do list that you would like to achieve next week? As human beings, we are designed to be not just powered by the Holy Spirit to draw breath, but to be empowered by the Holy Spirit, to partner with God to be more than we could ever be on our own, to partner with God to do more than we could ever do on our own. Not just to have a nice, good, comfortable life, but that God's work and his kingdom would get built through our lives. I wonder how your next week would look different if you went into it empowered by the Holy Spirit. Does anybody know who... Oh no, that won't work. There's a person. There she is. Who's that? That's right, it's Jackie Pullinger. That's why I shouldn't make things up on the fly. This is a woman called Jackie Pullinger. Jackie Pullinger grew up in London in a completely ordinary home. She had nominal Christian parents who took her to church Christmas and Easter, but not particularly kind of like regular church goers. As a teenager, she came to faith in Jesus through her local church, through reading her Bible, and she became convinced that God was real and active and that he could be trusted with her whole life. Now, Jackie is not a particularly dramatic person, not particularly charismatic or especially confident, but she developed a growing conviction that God had called her to go and serve him overseas. The problem was that nobody agreed with her. Mission agencies turned her down. She had no theological training. She had no experience, no clear destination. She had no obvious gifts that would make her suitable for the work. And again and again, she was told by human beings that she simply wasn't the right person for the job. Eventually, she felt God say very simply, just go and I will show you. And so she did something that most of us would probably describe as reckless. She bought a one-way ticket out of the UK without a clear idea of where she was gonna end up. And that journey eventually took her to Hong Kong in the 1960s and into Kowloon Walled City, one of the most dangerous lawless places in the world at that time. It was a place that even the police avoided. It was filled with heroin addiction, organized crime, violence, and deep despair. It's a bit like Cheltenham. Jackie was a young, single British woman. She didn't speak the language. She had no protection, no plan, no program, and no idea how to deal with what she was seeing. And reality hit really quick. She encountered people who were trapped in addiction. The doctor said they could not be cured without long medical treatment. And she encountered a spiritual darkness that her upbringing just hadn't prepared her for. And she realized something crucial. Something that she, you know, everything that she'd relied on before, her personality or her connections, you know, all of that was utterly insufficient. And so she did the only thing that she could do. She prayed. Not kind of polished prayers, not confident prayers, nothing you'd find written down in a book, but desperate prayers. She began to learn from other Chinese Christians about the Holy Spirit, not as a kind of theoretical doctrine, but as a living presence, as the presence of God who empowers ordinary believers just like her. She began to pray for people expecting God to act, not because she was gifted, but because she had no alternative. She prayed for heroin addicts and many of them were instantly healed. Withdrawal symptoms just disappeared like that. Lives were changed. Hardened criminals were transformed, became Christians, became leaders, became pastors. And what grew from this work continues through the St. Stephen's Society. But Jackie was always really clear about this. It wasn't her strength, her courage, or her skill which motivated her. She remained single. She was often lonely, often afraid, frequently overwhelmed. She didn't become self-sufficient. She became dependent. Again and again, she would reach the end of herself and discover that the Spirit of God was sufficient, was everything that she needed. Her life is not a story of somebody who felt powerful. It's a story of someone who knew that she wasn't. And that is precisely why the power of God could rest upon her. She once described this turning point in her ministry, which was very simple, with words that any of us could pray today and should pray. Standing in the middle of the suffering that she couldn't fix, the danger that she couldn't control, and the needs that she couldn't meet, she simply came to the conclusion, I cannot do this. I cannot do this. So not all of us here today are called to pray for heroin addicts in a far off land. Who knows, maybe some of us are. But I bet some of us could think of some examples in our lives where we're thinking, just like Jackie, I cannot do this. I cannot do that. That is too big for me. That is too much for me. Can I just quick sidebar say that if that does describe your life right now, if there are a handful of things that you're looking at and going, I can't do any of that. Can I just say thank you for being here this afternoon. We really appreciate you coming and being part of this congregation in this church. I've found in the past when I've had a list of those things, frankly, coming to church is the last thing that I want to do. So if you're here today and that describes you, thank you and fair play. That takes some serious courage. But even if your life is pretty simple and straightforward right now, Jackie's story is a challenge to all of us, isn't it? A challenge for us to ask what God might be calling us into in the future, which might right now seem completely impossible and scary and out of our comfort zone. Frankly, calling us into the kind of things... Oh, that's me, sorry. It's telling me to stop speaking. No. Calling us into the kind of things that would complicate our lives, make our lives more complicated and basically populate our lives with lots of I cannot do that. So let's ask, as we bring this into land, in what ways do we need to be empowered by the Holy Spirit this week? In what ways do I need to be empowered by the Holy Spirit? What are the things that are in front of me that I'm saying, I cannot do this, I cannot do that. Maybe you are looking to be filled with wisdom and insight and direction. You have a big question ahead of you and you don't know where to go. You need some insight like Simeon or Anna or Zechariah in Luke 1 and 2. You might need to be empowered for that. Or maybe you're being asked to go further, to do bigger, greater things, impossible things, things that you never thought that you'd be able to do, to go beyond what is possible for a human. You're definitely going to need to be empowered for that. Maybe we've stepped out of our comfort zone already. We've already said yes to Jesus. We're already kind of halfway down the road of having said yes to him and we feel like we've kind of run out of momentum. We've run out of steam. We're like one of those balloons on the floor. We're going to need to be empowered for that. And maybe it's just to get up and do the things that we need to do. You know, those things that we just need to do to get this week finished. Maybe we need to be empowered for that. There's no shame in that. There's no shame in coming to God and saying, Lord, I need to be empowered to be a good parent this week. I need to be empowered to show up to work this week. I need to be empowered to be kind to that person that really frustrates me this week. Or maybe all of this talk of being filled with the Holy Spirit, experiencing the presence of God, you're sitting there thinking, I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. And you'd like to know what I'm talking about. We'd love to pray for you that the Holy Spirit would meet you and encounter you and empower you, wouldn't we? Yeah\n\nwe have what's God been doing of I had a terrifying XYZ, I didn't know what to do about ABC, but I really felt like the Holy Spirit empowered me and this is what I did, et cetera, et cetera. Sounds good? So the main thing we're gonna do is we're gonna get back into those groups. If you would like somebody to stand with you and pray with you, just one-on-one, we would also love to do that. So if you're saying, I don't know what it means to be filled with the Holy Spirit, that's a one-on-one type prayer. No, actually, we could do that in small groups. You guys know what you're doing. Let's get into those groups. If you would like someone to stand with you, then both of these wings are available for that purpose. Please do go and stand there. I will be running around tapping GVC people on the shoulder and saying, oi, go and pray for that person. In a moment, the kiddos are gonna come back in and join us. Welcome them when they do. And then Chez and I will kind of wrap things up. But with whatever time we've got left, let's make those little groups. Let's pray for one another. Let's share as deeply as we feel comfortable to. And then the kiddos will come back in and we will wrap everything up."

    "transcript": "than I had previously. And that second time was a very, very hard lesson to learn. But I believe that God was giving me a taste of what it means to be completely helpless. The crippling anxiety and the despair that I felt was horrible, but it did give me a physical experience of the thing that I was needing to learn from a spiritual sense, that I cannot do this on my own. I cannot save myself. No amount of hard work, dutiful living, success, power, good relationships, or anything else saves me and allows me to experience the blessing of God. Any, any good thing that God wants to give me and give you is not something that we have earned. The gift of forgiveness, which leads to eternal life with Him, is given to those who have realized what it is that they actually deserve. The younger son's plan, his request to return as a slave in his father's house, would have stemmed from his knowledge of what would happen when he returned to the village. He would have been expecting the villagers to enact a dreaded ceremony of ket-tartsa as soon as they saw him nearing home. And this was a punishment for any Jewish male who had lost his inheritance to the Gentiles. And what it would have involved is the villagers would have come out to meet the son, and they would have brought a large pot, and it would have been filled, somewhat oddly to us, perhaps, with burnt nuts and corn. And they would have smashed it in front of him. And they would have shouted, you are cut off from your people. And from that point on, there could be no contact with any member of the community and the returning boy would be unable to enter the village ever again. It was a punishment that was greatly feared, almost a fate worse than death. And according to that Jewish custom, banishment through the ket-tartsa ceremony, which would effectively make dead the younger son, that, according to Jewish law, was what he deserved. He deserved to be made dead. And so with that in mind, the younger son is wanting to try and redeem himself from the death sentence. And it is the same, friends, for us. The punishment that we deserve for our sinful disobedience towards God is death. But our Father has other ideas. And Jesus has already given an indication, which might feel quite subtle to us, but I think would have kind of really been writ loud to his original hearers, that the father in this story represents God because the father, right from the beginning of the story, can do things that wouldn't even have been permitted under Jewish law. He wouldn't have been allowed, if this was real, to sell his land in order to give the younger son his inheritance that he was asking for. Usually the landowner, the father, would have to have died before that could be permitted. So Jesus is actually already saying, this isn't a usual father. He's not governed by the customs of the land. This father is actually kind of almost beyond death already. And then this same father defies convention by eagerly watching and waiting for the son who was dead to him, should have been dead to him. And that's consistent with how we see God at work through the Old Testament. Simon referenced earlier on that escape from Egypt through the Red Sea. God gives his people, Israel, his son, that's how Israel's referred to in the Old Testament, so many, so many repeated opportunities to return to his loving care. So keen is the father in the story to welcome home his son that he runs out to meet him, knowing that he must reach him before the villagers do, before they enact that ket-har-tsa ceremony. And graciously sidestepping the son's self-help plea, I thought the way Annie read it was just so beautiful, that the son is kind of tripping over himself to get his words out and the father's like, doesn't even let him say, treat me like one of your hired hands. The father makes it absolutely clear that the son is returning home as a son and as an heir. There is a ring for his finger, there's sandals for his feet, there is the best robe for him to wear. It's the robe of forgiveness that covers all that the father is saying, that's now in the past, it's done, I don't see it anymore. And then he begins the preparations for this massive, lavish celebration of welcome home. All the son has to do is to receive, to let the immense, unconditional generosity of his father seep into his tired, once dead heart. Knowing God's forgiveness, being welcomed home into that warm embrace of God's love comes through the acceptance that we deserve nothing. And yet, despite that, Jesus loved us, loved the world so much that he was willing to take the punishment and the shame for our own sinful state. And I think that we glimpse something of the scandal of the father's actions through the anger of the older son. The father in the parable, just like Jesus on the cross, is taking the shame of the younger son onto himself and he's letting it go. And then he is completely transforming the situation by throwing a magnificent party. And Paul, Saint Paul, who I mentioned earlier, he knew God's resurrection power in his own life and he describes this transformation beautifully in Ephesians chapter 2 and if you want to kind of dwell in God's word for a bit this week I would point you towards Ephesians 2, that's an incredible chapter and I've, hopefully God doesn't mind, but I'm kind of about to read an edited highlights of Ephesians 2. It's short enough to be a tweet for those of you who are familiar with Twitter. But just hear these words as we come to a finish. Paul writes, you were dead through the sins in which you once lived. But God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive together with Christ. For by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God. Not the result of works so that no one may boast. And now, in Christ Jesus, you who were once far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. Let's live, brothers and sisters, as forgiven people, brought home by God through the immeasurable sacrifice.\n\nof Jesus, and from this place of utter dependence on God's grace and mercy flows all of the things that we're going to explore in the coming weeks. But for now, be still and know the love of your Heavenly Father who every day is looking out for you, ready to hitch up his metaphorical robes and run to you and welcome you home. Amen."

    "transcript": "This morning's Bible reading is from Matthew's Gospel, chapter 2, beginning at verse 1. If you want to follow it in a church Bible, that's page 2 in the New Testament section. In the time of King Herod, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, asking, Where is the child who has been born King of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising and have come to pay him homage. When King Herod heard this, he was frightened, and all Jerusalem with him. And calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. They told him, In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it has been written by the prophet. And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah, for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people Israel. Then Herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared. Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, so that I may also go and pay him homage. When they had heard the king, they set off, and there ahead of them went the star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw that the star had stopped, they were overwhelmed with joy. On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their own country by another road. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Graham, thanks very much for reading. Let me add my welcome to Gemma's and bid you a happy new year as well. Here's a question for you just as we begin this first Sunday of the new year. Who made it to midnight on New Year's Eve? Put up your hand and give me a wave if you made it to midnight. Well done. Who managed maybe to get to 10 o'clock before they dozed off in the chair? Caroline, well done. Thank you for your honesty. Hands up if you had no intention of getting to midnight, and so you were warmly tucked up in bed. Well done, you increasingly courageous few. Well, on New Year's Eve, I found myself doing lots of exciting things, catching up with friends, but one of them was sort of like a biblical trivial pursuit. I must admit, it's something that I've never played before. It was slightly niche, but the family that I was partying with really enjoyed it, and so we all played biblical trivial pursuit together. I have a biblical trivial pursuit question for you, and I'm going to encourage you to turn to the people around you and to see what answer you can come up with. How many kings were there in the story that we've just heard, the well-known epiphany story? How many kings were there? Off you go. Have a conversation with the people around you. See what you come up with. Excellent. Let me break into your conversations. It's quite intriguing, isn't it? Actually, the answer is way more intriguing, perhaps, than we might think as we get into this well-known but perhaps slightly mysterious and intriguing passage. So as we do that, I'm going to pray for us that the Lord would guide us just as he guided those magi. Let's pray together. Lord, we thank you so much that this passage is all about coming to worship you, no matter how many kings there were. It's all about coming to worship you, who you are, and what we bring to worship you. And so we pray this morning that you'd help us to know you better, that in knowing you better we might know how to worship you more fully, not just this Sunday, but every day of the year ahead. In your name we pray. Amen. Well, it's really going to help if you have your Bible open in front of you. Page 2 in the New Testament sections. Our Bibles are built to design and confuse. And so you'll need to turn to the New Testament section and find page 2, about two-thirds of the way through where the numbering restarts in the New Testament. The answer to that question, how many kings were there in the Matthew 2 story, is, at least the short answer, is three kings. But it might not be the three kings that you initially thought of or who were talking about. Matthew 2, chapter 1, begins like this. In the time of King Herod, there's King 1, after Jesus was born in Jerusalem, or sorry, in Bethlehem of Judea, magi from the east came to Jerusalem, asking, where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? So we're introduced to the first of the three kings straight away. King Herod, the political leader of the Jews. Not so much the religious leader, but the political leader. He's sort of the mayor of London, as opposed to being the Archbishop of Canterbury. And he kind of ruled over, politically, the area of Jerusalem and Judea and the wider countryside. In fact, Herod was an Edomite. I did a little bit of research into what an Edomite was. Edom literally means red. Herod's family ancestors came from the red sandstone city of Petra in modern-day Jordan. Over the Christmas period, you may have watched a great many films, some of which may have been worth watching. One of my favourite Christmas films, which was actually on a couple of nights ago, was Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. And if you watched Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, you might know Petra. It's the place with the treasury that they approach at the end through the deserts, as I say, of modern-day Jordan. Back in the Old Testament, you might remember that Abraham had a son, Isaac, and that Isaac had two sons of his own. Esau, the eldest son, who by rights should have inherited his father's wealth. And Jacob, the youngest son. And you might remember in that story that Esau, the eldest son, in a totally kind of carefree way, sold his inheritance for a bowl of stew. Well, Esau's descendants went off to form the kingdom of Edom. Jacob's descendants went off to Jerusalem and formed the people of Israel. And Herod's ancestors from Edom were continually at war and in conflict with his brother's descendants, the Jews in Jerusalem. So King Herod, who had actually been forcibly converted, or his family had been forcibly converted to Judaism, here he was as leader of the Jewish people. It was an uneasy relationship between him and the people he ruled over. But that's not the whole story. We know that there's a second king lurking in the wings. This king actually never really comes on stage in our story, but the presence of this king is felt everywhere. And he'll be familiar to you by the name Caesar. The king or the emperor of Rome, whose empire had conquered all of those Mediterranean lands, and who ruled very cleverly by installing puppet kings, Herod being one of them, who would do his every bidding, particularly when it came to raising taxation and promoting the power and security of Roman rule and the empire. If you can identify earthly kings\n\nand queens, by whose head is on the currency, then coins have been discovered with both Herod's head on them and also Caesar's head on them. And in fact, the names that go along with Caesar's head on those coins are really interesting. Lots of those coins proclaim him as Divus Julius. Julius Caesar thought he was God. We get our modern name Diva from it, somebody who thinks they have a God-like status. And on the day in 42 BC where Caesar was proclaimed a god in Rome, where he was called a saviour, there was a comet in the sky that stayed around for seven days. The Romans took it as a great omen. So three kings. We've met King Herod. We've met Emperor or King Caesar. And then we're introduced in verse 2 to the third of the kings, a humble child born to be king of the Jews and king of kings. The one who later in the passage, in verse 4, is called the Messiah, God's promised king. Messiah is a Hebrew word. It means God's anointed king. The Greek version of Messiah is the name Christ or Christos, where we get our name for the oil that we use to anoint kings today. When we anointed Charles King, the oil that he was anointed with behind that screen that they put up is called the oil of chrism. It's linked to the name Christ. It means anointed king. And verses 5 and 6 tell us that Jesus is going to be following on from his anointed shepherd king ancestor, King David, who was also born, you might remember, in the town of Bethlehem. So three kings. Herod, Caesar, and Jesus. The people who we may have thought of as kings in our Christmas story may not actually have been kings at all. Sorry to burst your bubble if that's the case. Verse 1, if you notice, calls them magi. They travelled from the east. That's what we know about them, possibly a very long distance and perhaps on camels. But we don't know whether they were kings or not. And we don't know how many of them there were, although they bring three gifts and so the supposition is that there were three of them. Actually, the Bible, if you notice in the Bible passage, doesn't number them at all. We just know that there are three gifts. You might see in the footnote in the Bible, if you've got your specs on or have particularly good eyesight, that the word magi can also be translated astrologer. It's where we get our English word magician from. So almost certainly the occupation of these people wasn't kinging. It was astrologing. That was their thing. But if we think of them as some kind of showman or cheap conjurers, that's not really doing them justice. There may have been those types of people amongst their wider colleagues, people who were sort of interested in kudos and showmanship. But it seems as if these people diligently studied the stars because they were seeking to understand in a deeper way the realities of a greater power beyond this world. They wanted to know how that power might want to interact with them. And they wanted to interact with it as well. They may well have come from Babylon in the east. That's one of the fairly commonly held theories. Babylon had a particularly strong history with reading the stars and trying to interpret them. And you might remember that Babylon was where God's people had been called on exile earlier in the Old Testament. You might remember from the book of Daniel that Daniel and his friends were taken off to Babylon. Perhaps it was that Daniel and his friends had told their Babylonian captors all about the coming king who God had promised to them. They may well have alluded to the prophecy of Micah which was written in the time or before the time that Daniel and his friends were there. So actually they would have known the words of Micah. Those words are recorded for us in Matthew 2 or some of Micah's words. But you, O Bethlehem Ephrata, who were too little among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days. Given that billing that the prophet Micah gives to King Jesus, you can understand why King Herod was in verse 3 described as being frightened. He presumably thought that ruling Israel was his role and he got there by suppressing all opposition. His natural instinct was not going to allow a pretender to go unchallenged. Equally, his political instinct was that King Caesar wasn't going to be too chuffed either. Caesar was going around, a different Caesar by this point, but was going around with titles like God and Son of God and Saviour and was used to having special stars pointing to his crowning. Neither of them were going to be particularly pleased. And so perhaps in verse 7 it's no surprise that Herod interviews the Magi full of his pantomime-like cunning. I'm not sure if you've seen a pantomime over the last few days, but Herod certainly fits the role of a pantomime villain, albeit one that has actually the ability to deliver on his murderous schemes. Verse 7, he sends the wise men on their way. Verse 8, locate the child and to report back supposedly so that he could go and worship too. But we know how that turns out later in chapter 2. Perhaps it's no surprise not only to read of Herod's murderous plotting, but also to read that having travelled such a long way and invested so much in finding this promised king, that verse 10, when the wise men get there, they are overwhelmed with joy. This has been a journey probably for months if not years. And now they have found the one who they've been looking for. Imagine their joy, verse 10. And so verse 11, they kneel down and worship. And their worship is proved genuine by in part the gifts that they offer. As I was sat there on Christmas Day unwrapping gifts and giving gifts, I wondered to myself whether gifts say more about the giver or the receiver. You might like to replay some of your Christmas gifts in your mind and think, I wonder whether that says more about me or more about the person who gave it to me. Perhaps the person's generosity. And you think, gosh, that was more than I really expected them to give. I'm so grateful for that. I didn't realize that I meant perhaps that much to them. Perhaps as you unwrapped the slightly unique gift that some people may have given you and you looked at it quizzically, this mystery that you were unwrapping in front of you and you thought, is this talking about me or is this talking about you or the present that may have been recycled out of your recycling presents drawer? Gifts can say quite a lot about the person they're given to. And quite rightly at this time of year, we tend to focus and sermons often tend to focus. Today, there will be thousands of sermons across the world that focus quite rightly on what these gifts tell us about Jesus, the person they were given to. Gold for the King of Kings, frankincense for the great high priest, myrrh for the one who was born to die for our sins and to be raised again. And that is completely correct. But I did wonder this year as I was opening my gifts, I wonder what these gifts say about the people who gave them. Jesus, I give you my gold. I submit to you my earthly life, my ambitions, my possessions, my wealth, my\n\nmaterial goods, my physical body, I submit that to you. Jesus, I submit to you the frankincense of my life. I submit to you my spiritual being. I recognise that I am an unsteady captain of my soul. And so I submit to you and put under you my spiritual self and being. Jesus, I submit to you the myrrh of my being. I submit to you my death, not just my life. If you asked me at this time last year what you could pray for me, one of the things I would have said is that I would trust Jesus more in my life. As I've gone through this year, I've recognised that my prayer has changed somewhat because at this point last year, I was sat there thinking to myself, Simon, if you don't trust Jesus with your life, how on earth are you going to trust him with your death? When I got through to February the 18th and a slightly unexpected diagnosis from the doctor, I learned quite quickly that I was going to need to trust Jesus with my death and not just with my life. Myrrh, do I worship Jesus with trusting him with my death as well as with my life? So as we come into land, where does that familiar story leave us this morning at the beginning of 2026, almost 2,000 years later? Well, it might encourage us to look at this story and to think God has clearly got a plan that he is working out. As we look at this story, the things we've talked about this morning, God has been working that plan out for literally thousands of years. We've mentioned King David, we've mentioned Abraham, we've mentioned the prophet Micah, we've mentioned Daniel, we've mentioned Babylon, we've mentioned wise men traveling across the desert for months, if not years. We've mentioned young kings and old prophets. We've thought about teenage mothers and rough and ready shepherds. We've got intellectual wise men. We've got people who, when we look at them, they look like me. I've got people who don't look like me. We've got people from all across the planet. These events that God works together show us that history is not chance. When we look at world politics, quite often in free fall or seeming free fall and chaos, this story is a reminder that God is in control. He hasn't left the building. And he has got a plan that he is working out. And that plan fundamentally is actually centered on the kind of the gravitational pull of history is towards Jesus, his death and his resurrection. The fact that he is the king of kings and that he's the great high priest. The supreme proof of all of that is the death and resurrection of Jesus. That's the center of gravity of history that this story points to, and that's where history still points to today. We point back to Jesus even as we move back to the future. The story also shows us, I think, how easy it is to become or to fall into the Herod trap. To be so selfishly committed to our own rule and to the projection of our own personality. So confident in our self-reliance that actually our natural instinct becomes one of killing off all opposition or threat. The fact that the Bible story this morning notes that all Jerusalem were frightened with Herod shows that this wasn't just a Herod-shaped problem. And although we might look at Herod and condemn him as a murderous pantomime villain, actually there's something in Herod that we recognize in each of us. The Herod instinct, we might call it, still infects leaders, it still infects governments. It infects business boardrooms, it infects academic institutions, it infects community clubs, it affects family life, it affects individuals at every level. But the story also shows us that with real commitment and sacrifice, the worship that the wise men bring to Herod is also something that we can bring as well. It asks us the question, what does our worship tell us about who we think Jesus is? And what does our worship tell us about who we think we are? I wonder if you've ever thought about that. What do the songs that I sing, what do the things I volunteer, what do the actions that I perform, what does the worship that I bring show about who I think Jesus is? Are there things that are missing? Are there things that I want to do a little bit more? How do I look at my life of worship and what it tells me? As I was growing up, I can remember a notice board on our church curtilage, and it was right in the centre of town. And it used to have this sign that we put up quite regularly during Epiphany. It said, 2,000 years ago, wise men sought Jesus. 2,000 years later, wise people still do. In our church in the last few months, and stretching back further, there have been a number of people who have, in my view, very wisely been seeking Jesus. People, many of whom have had no previous association with church or with seeking after Jesus. And it's been a privilege to see people doing that. I wonder whether that's a great thing for us to do this new year as we acknowledge Jesus as our King, the one before whom we lay our physical lives, our ambitions, our wealth, the one before whom we lay our spiritual lives, everything that our soul contains, the one before whom we lay not just our lives, but our death and our resurrection as well. God bless us into this new year. Amen."

    "transcript": "Lord God, I want to thank you so much that you came down to this earth, that you came from a throne as a baby. And God, that you came to bring your light and your light to all people. Amen. There's something really special about light. Something really special that kind of draws us in. If you think of a single candle in a room, in a dark, dark room, how even that smallest flame brings light and joy and warmth. Light brings safety, brings clarity. I noticed the band all setting up all panicking because they couldn't see. It brings direction. It brings hope. And scripture starts right at the beginning in Genesis with, let there be light. And it ends with the radiant glory of God illuminating the new creation. So it shouldn't surprise us much that Jesus chose light as one of the most powerful pictures in the New Testament. And it is who he is and who he calls us to be. So at Christmas, we celebrate the astonishing truth that I think it is incredible that God stepped down into humanity as a child, fragile, small and humble. And yet his coming lit up the world. John 1 tells us the light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not, and I would say cannot, overcome it. But Jesus doesn't just bring light. He doesn't bring light with him. Jesus is light. And just notice how his birth is accompanied by light. We've sung about it and we've heard about it. The star that guided the wise men. The angelic radiance that was seen in the skies when they appeared with the shepherds. And a promise that was fulfilled that said the people who walk in great darkness have seen a great light. For me, the Christmas story says, you have not been forgotten. Light has come for you. When Jesus stood in the court temple, as we heard Carrie read it, it was during the festival of tabernacles. And the festival of tabernacles, there were big, huge bowls of fire. And those big bowls of fire represented how God had led the people in the wilderness by fire. And he said, I am the light of the world. It wasn't random. It wasn't kind of like, oh, yeah, okay, I can see some light around me. Maybe I'll say, yeah, I'm the light of the world. It wasn't random. It was meant to fulfill the prophecies that he has come, that he is that light in the darkness. And those flames in the festival of tabernacles represented God's presence. God's guidance is God's protection. And Jesus stands there and goes, hey, by the way, it's me. It's me. I'm that light. I am that guidance. I am that presence. He didn't simply teach a truth to the people in the synagogue. He said, he is the truth. He didn't simply give them guidance. He said, I, Jesus, I am the way. He didn't simply bring hope. He brought life. And he brought life and life to the fullness. And for me, that's so exciting because what that means is wherever Jesus is, the darkness has lost its power. The darkness runs through every part of life. For those who don't know, I work with some pretty sad people. I work in mental health. And I see day in, day out the darkness that the world is filled with. It's filled with fear. It's filled with shame. It's filled with injustice. It's filled with hatred. It's filled with despair. But when Jesus enters, when he enters a life, when he enters a home, when he enters a community, when he even just enters a moment, things shift. Every time a client comes in to see me, I pray, God, please break in in a moment today. And I want to tell you that God breaks in every single time. It might only be a moment, but God shows up. Because light exposes what's hidden. Light reveals a path forward. Light makes growth possible. Light defeats darkness. But most importantly, without fighting. It doesn't fight. It simply is. Light simply is present and brings life. And I'm really glad because Jesus does not ask us to generate this kind of light ourselves. Because only he can. Only Jesus is the light of the world. He is the source of that light. He does ask us to do something pretty cool, I think anyway. Jesus in Matthew 5 says, he turns to his followers, like a band of complete and utter misfits who kind of were, let's just say, not always the brightest bunch. And he says, you, you, you're the light of the world. Every single one of us in here, you are the light of the world. The one who comes is light. And he declares it that we share in his role. We share in that excitement and joy to bring light into life. Think about the Christmas star for a moment. It didn't save anybody. It didn't speak. It didn't perform miracles. It simply did what God had ordained it to do, to shine. And by shining, it guided people to Jesus. And that is what God calls us to do. He guides us and calls us to point people back to the source. We don't need to be impressive or extraordinary. We don't need to have the answers. We don't need to feel wonderful. We don't have to have it all sorted. We don't have to feel like we're great and on top of the world. We simply just need to shine the light of Jesus because he's placed it within each and every one of us. And that light is what draws people to hope. So maybe you're sat here being like, well, how do I do that? That sounds a bit like a bit, okay, let's be light. I'm a candle. We're not. Like, I don't think that really points people to Jesus, me pretending to be a candle, does it? No. But we shine when loving is hard. When we forgive somebody. When we're kind. When we show compassion. When we show patience. Let's think about that over Christmas when we're getting together with people and we have to show forgiveness and kindness and compassion and patience. I don't know about you, but I definitely am going to have to show that this Christmas because those are not natural things for me. And I'm guessing they're probably not natural for you either. But they're supernatural. They reveal Jesus. Another way is when we tell truth in confusion. Not with harshness, not by I'm right and you're wrong, but with clarity and humility. When we bring a word of truth to somebody. When we look somebody in the eye and we tell them that they're wonderful even when they don't feel like they are. Maybe you've got friends or family where they believe things that aren't true about themselves. Maybe this Christmas you can bring light to them by sharing what Jesus says about them. We shine when we practice mercy. When we see people the way that Jesus sees them. Especially the overlooked. We shine by living with hope. We are a people of hope. It's not naive optimism. We don't all think the world is going to be great all of the time. But we can have a deep trust that God has it. God is at work. Even when we've prayed for a million times for something and he's not answered. God is still at work. And we shine when we refuse to show what God has done in our lives. Jesus said that the lamp isn't meant to be hidden under a bowl or a basket. Our faith is not supposed to be invisible. We're not supposed to be a Christian on a Sunday and praise Jesus and then hide it. I often tell people about I grew up with people who weren't Christians.\n\nthough I thought. Until I was saved and I walked into a church, I discovered all of my friends were Christians and they had never told me. And I had known them for like 15 years. Jesus does not call us to hide our hope under a basket. He calls us to live it out. Light is meant to be seen. But here's the beautiful thing. It's less beautiful for me because this isn't something I find hard, but I'm sure it's beautiful for other people. And that is that light doesn't have to be loud. I'm probably one of the loudest people in the room. I love the sound of my own voice sometimes. But it doesn't have to be. A single candle is quiet, it's still, and it's gentle. But it changes the whole room. The world may feel dark at times, harsh, divided, anxious, but that only makes Christ's light even more noticeable as it shines with his promise. A single star lit the way to Bethlehem and one candle is beautiful. But a hundred candles, a thousand candles, a whole community illuminated by many small flames becomes radiant. The early church didn't conquer the Roman Empire through wealth or armies or power. They did it by shining small, faithful lights, feeding the hungry, caring for the sick, welcoming the stranger, forgiving their enemies, and refusing to abandon one another, one flame at a time. The light of Christ was multiplied. And that's how the world still changes. It's not by spectacular displays of strength, but through a steady glow of lives surrendered to Jesus, lives that reflect his light. And a single flame can light another, and another, and another. And that's how God's light spreads, quietly, steadily, beautifully. Jesus is the source of that flame, but we carry it in our homes, in our friendships, in our workplaces, in our communities, our conversations, and our choices. And thankfully, Christmas is not just about Jesus coming once or the light coming once. It's a reminder that the light continues to shine now. Over 2,000 years, that light has continued to shine. And when we shine, we become the modern-day Christmas stars, guiding people towards the grace and presence of Jesus. As the band come up, we're going to light this single candle to represent Christ. The light of the world was born in Bethlehem. The star rose in the heavens, and the flame that darkness could not overcome. This candle represents Christ, the light of the world. It's not a symbol of our strength, but of his presence. It's not a display of our goodness, but his grace. From one flame, we're going to pass it person to person through the room, candle to candle. And as the lights spread through the room, you'll see how darkness is pushed back without a sound. You'll see how one flame becomes many. We'll see how Christ's light is not diminished by being shared. But don't just light your candle as a symbolic act. Make it a commitment. As you light your candle, maybe you want to whisper a simple prayer. Make me the light of the world. Then as you pass your light to the next, remember that this is what discipleship looks like. Offering the light of Jesus to somebody else, not by force, but by invitation. You are not the source of the flame. You simply carry it. And that is enough. So let's spread the light."

    "transcript": "The reading is taken from the first letter of John, chapter 4, starting from verse 7, and this can be found on page 260 of the Church New Testament. Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love doesn't know God, because God is love. This is how God showed his love among us. He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us. This is how we know that we live in him and he in us. He has given us of his Spirit, and we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world. If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. And so we know and rely on the love of God that he has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God and God in them. This is how love is made complete among us, so that we will have confidence on the day of judgement. In this world we are like Jesus. There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. We love because he first loved us. Whoever claims to love God, yet hates a brother or sister, is a liar. For whoever doesn't love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen. And he has given us this command. Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Well, good morning. Lovely to see you all. It's the last time I'll stand up and look out here and be able to see each one of you. Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. God is love. And I just noticed in that reading how important it is to love your brother and sister. Well, if I had read this at the age of five, I would have been acutely dismayed, because I certainly didn't love my brother. And it has taken a long time to come to love my brother. It's easy to say that God is love, but how difficult we can find it to actually grasp that, for it to get from our heads to our hearts. It's a long journey. Maybe our experience of love has been inadequate or faulty. Yes, we should respect God in that sense of fear, but we often tend to be afraid of God in the wrong way. That is, until we get to know him. We have to get through that barrier. Our image of God could be of a poor father whose family, at the worst, experience a reign of terror. Trust takes time to build, especially when it has been broken. How could God explain that he was not like that fierce father? How could he correct that image? How could he show himself as the good and loving father he is? We often just didn't and still don't always get it. Paul, in his letter to the Ephesians, shows how well he understands this, because he prays for the Ephesians that they will really be able to grasp just how wonderful God's love is, how high, how deep, how wide. He tells them to be rooted and grounded in love. A few of us here meet weekly online with other Christians for an hour of poetry. We call our group Belief in Poetry. We grapple with poetry written over the centuries, poems dealing with faith or the lack of it, poems dealing with love. Now, Andrew Smith is kindly coming to read us a poem by one of our favorite poets, R.S. Thomas. Now, don't panic if you don't immediately get it. You're not thick. It's amazing how long our group can spend trying to understand a poet or poem. This poem is perfect for Advent as we draw ever so close to Christmas. It's called The Coming. God held in his hand a small globe. Look, he said. The sun looked. Far off, as through water, he saw a scorched land of fierce color. The light burned there. Crusted buildings cast their shadows. A bright serpent, a river uncoiled itself, radiant with slime. On a bare hill, a bare tree saddened the sky. Many people held out their thin arms to it as though waiting for a banished April to return to its crossed boughs. The sun watched them. Let me go there, he said. And God the Father did let his son go there or come here to show them, us, what he was like, what love was like. His only son. How else could he explain his love? This is what I'm like and this is how much I love you. This is how precious you are. Let's try another tack. I have a short story to tell you. That might be easier. There was a farmer who lived in a remote place and I'm imagining that remote place was somewhere in the middle of the prairies. And one night there was a violent storm. The farmer was warm and safe inside but the storm battered his windows. And as he opened his curtains, a flock of birds whirled desperately seeking shelter. They hurled themselves against the window, attracted by the light, time and time again. The distressed farmer wanted to tell the flock of birds that they would find safety in the nearby barn where the door was wide open. But they kept trying to enter his home through the window. How can I explain\n\nHe thought, if I went out there, they would be afraid of me. But if I was to become one of them, I could guide them into the barn into safety. We can make love complicated. And I very nearly did. I attempted to re-read C.S. Lewis, The Four Loves, in preparation for this sermon. C.S. Lewis was a very bright man. He taught at Oxbridge and his thoughts are definitely higher than mine. With all his intellectual, academic and philosophical rigour, he explores love in a small but dense volume, The Four Loves. What exactly is love? Well, he divides love into different categories. Storge, affection, philia, friendship, eros, romantic love, agape, gift love, the purest kind of love, God's love. I decided that since I am not C.S. Lewis, I will simply commend his book to you if you would like to go deeper. Mine is a simpler approach. God is love is mystery enough for me. During this past week, I have seen everything through a lens of love. And this is a diary of love through the prism of others. On Monday, I had a WhatsApp message telling me that Grace Payne had died. Peacefully in her home on the 35th floor of the Barbican at the age of 101. Who was this Grace Payne? Well, I was born on her 21st birthday, which always gave us something of a bond and made it easy to calculate how old one another were. She became my guardian from the age of 16 to 21, when my parents were abroad. But I first met her when I was 14. We were moving house and she and her husband and three children were to be our new next door neighbours. But they already lived close to where we were going to live, where our new houses were being built. In order to make the transition for me easier than it might have been, school-wise, Grace invited me to stay with her family for about three months before we actually moved. Later, living next door, I spent a lot of time with Grace, who provided something of a role model and broadened my experience of love, warmth and relationship, as well as encouraging me in dressmaking, appreciation of classical music and watching the programme some will remember, Tonight with Cliff Mitchellmore. She was not a Christian as we know it. She and her husband, both scientists, would have probably called themselves agnostics or atheists. They came to my ordination, but I think it was a complete mystery to them. But when I went to boarding school in the Lake District for a year, at the age of 17, it was Grace who jumped in her little sports car to come down to see me from Glasgow, and she took me out for a meal. It was sheer grace. She didn't have to love or care for me, but I believe it was God's provision at that time, in that rather bleak time where I had lost my home for the time being. As far as I know, she was not aware of the source of her love. It certainly wasn't forced. She was living in the unforced rhythms of grace. It's a mystery. Where does that love come from? Love is from God and love never fails. God's light shines in the darkest corners of our world and of our lives. And that light or love has never been put out. The love of God remains a mystery until we experience it, which is why we're told to love one another. Show one another what my love is like, says Jesus. Show one another the selfless love which gives of itself because God is love. Jesus came to rescue and to save, to guide people into the safety of the barn in the storm of life. On Tuesday, we, the weekly Connect Group, met for our Christmas Do. As usual, folk were welcomed with a smile and a cup of coffee or tea as they trickled in. When everyone was sitting comfortably, we listened to an Advent meditation on the theme of light. It was a quiet time of reflection. Then it was time to have a bit of fun, swapping gifts in a game of Secret Santa. A couple of people had prepared some homemade soup for 23 of us. Not just any old soup, but lovingly prepared with trimmings. And then we shared in a simple but lovely lunch. The atmosphere was a heartwarming mystery, a demonstration of love. A barn where we could shelter from the storm. On Wednesday, I took the funeral of Eileen Stonebridge. We mourned her loss but celebrated her life, which demonstrated God's love in many ways. God's love for her and her love for the created world and for others. Eileen was responsible for founding the nature reserve in Sneep Park by transforming a bit of waste ground. Had Eileen not known the love of God for her and continued right to the end of her life at the age of almost 90 to experience that grace and love, I don't think she would have been the hospitable and caring person she was. Her ministry included lots of tea and cake. She needed love, but she was also a channel of God's love to those who cared for her. More tea and cake. On Thursday, the meditation group put on a tea to wish me farewell. It was better than the Ritz. We remembered together some of the things we'd done over the past 30 years. There was an atmosphere of love and gratitude on a winter afternoon. Friday and Saturday have both added to aspects of love mediated through God's servants. Each day in some way I've been shown and have experienced the love of God through others. Thank you. Hope you got that, Jason. I've often pondered this verse. There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. Yes, love expels fear. How do we learn to rest in God's love and to trust it? I think it's a bit like learning to float. Do you remember how difficult that was to start with? Gradually you learn to trust that the water will support you. You have to try it and to relax. As you float on the ocean of God's love, the more confident you become in your salvation and acceptance by God. And this confidence leaves no room for anxiety or fear of condemnation. Our image of God is often too small or faulty. I used to imagine God as a ton of bricks God. i.e. if I did anything wrong, he would come down on me like a ton\n\nbricks. And I think this was something I learned from my childhood, sadly, where my parents were very strict, too strict really. So it's taken me a long time to unlearn that and to learn that God is different. I'm still discovering the depth of God's love, his kindness and slowness to anger. We have to be rooted and grounded in love and that understanding of God's love needs to go very deep. I've been in this church a long time now, since 1993, and I'm very glad I came here. In fact, the reason why I came here partly was because Paul Berg at Christchurch where I was said you should go to your local church. Well, I was living up on Church Road, so this was definitely my local church. But at that time there was a board outside the church which said a verse about loving God and being in the congregation. And somehow that spoke to me and which was an extra encouragement to come in here. It's often the people I meet, not necessarily in church, who mediate God's love and kindness. As I prepare to move to a new place in the new year, I'm grateful for the ways I've experienced his love here over many years and through many people. New every morning has been God's love and faithfulness. Thank you for being his servants and channels of his grace and love, wittingly or unwittingly. In Jesus' farewell discourse, as it is called, in the Gospel of John, he reminds us to abide in him, to abide in his love and to continue to love one another. How? Well, as he has loved us. A bit of a tall order, but if we ever run out of love, he's always there to provide what we need. As our reading began, dear friends, let us love one another for love comes from God. I'm going away for Christmas. I'm going away tomorrow and I'll appreciate the time and space to savor the love of God so richly and recently experienced. And I hope you will be similarly warmed as you give and receive gifts and ponder the Christmas mysteries. God's coming to earth to be one of us, to be with us. Amen."

    "transcript": "The first reading is taken from Psalm 90, reading from verse 1, and it's the prayer of Moses, and you can find it on page 605 in the Church Bibles. Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting, you are God. You turn us back to dust and say, turn back, you mortals. For a thousand years in your sight are like yesterday when it is passed, or like a watch in the night. You sweep them away. They are like a dream, like grass that is renewed in the morning. In the morning it flourishes and is renewed. In the evening it fades and withers. For we are consumed by your anger. By your wrath we are overwhelmed. You have set out our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your countenance. For all our days pass away under your wrath, our years come to an end like a sigh. The days of our life are seventy years, or perhaps eighty if we are strong. Even then their span is only toil and trouble. They are soon gone and we fly away. Who considers the power of your anger? Your wrath is as great as the fear that is due to you. So teach us to count our days that we may gain a wise heart. Turn, O Lord, how long. Have compassion on your servants. Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love so that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us and for as many years as we have seen evil. Let your work be manifest to your servants and your glorious power to their children. Let the favour of the Lord our God be upon us and prosper for us the work of our hands. O prosper the work of our hands. This is the word of the Lord. The Gospel reading is from Luke chapter 1 beginning at verse 39. Mary visits Elizabeth. In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the hill country where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the child leapt in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and exclaimed with a loud cry, Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And why has this happened to me that the mother of my Lord comes to me? For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in my womb leapt for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfilment of what was spoken to her by the Lord. And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour for he has looked with favour on the lowly state of his servant. Surely from now on all generations will call me blessed for the mighty one has done great things for me and holy is his name. Indeed, his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation. He has shown strength with his arm. He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. He has brought down the powerful from their thrones and lifted up the lowly. He has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away empty. He has come to the aid of his child Israel in remembrance of his mercy according to the promise he made to our ancestors, to Abraham and to his descendants forever. And Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home. This is the gospel of the Lord. Praise to you, O Christ. Well, please do be seated. Just before I begin, Hazel mentioned that I was the DDO and I just wondered how many of you know what DDO stands for? A few of you. So DDO is Diocesan Director of Ordinance which means that I work with those who are exploring a call to licensed or ordained ministry and help them discern that. And then once they've been recommended for training, I also offer pastoral care to those who are training. And I'm actually working with some candidates in your congregation so that's fantastic. There is a theologian that I don't expect you to remember the name of. He's called Soren Kierkegaard and he tells the story about a duck church. And the duck preacher speaks to all the ducks and tells them that they have wings that they can fly with. And there are quacks of amen throughout the whole congregation. And he goes, no seriously, when you leave church you can fly. Quack, quack, quack. But do you know what the ducks did when they left church? They waddled because they didn't have anybody to encourage and support and challenge them to fly. And so the role of the DDO is to encourage, support and challenge people to fly. But for now, may I speak and may you hear in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. So sometimes the things teachers say to us when we're really young can stay with us, can't they? I've got a friend called Claire and when we were in primary school we were both kicked out of the school choir by a teacher that told us that we couldn't sing. Now looking back on this, I think it's more to do with the fact that we were giggling than the fact that we couldn't sing. But Claire took this to heart and she would never sing in public again. She loved music but she would only sing in the privacy of the shower where the acoustics were perfect and the audience was forgiving. But one day the choir director asked her to join the choir for a special service. She laughed a bit nervously and said, me? You must be joking. The only choir I belong to is the shampoo bottle. But the director persisted. She rang me and she said, Becca, what do you think? And I said, Claire, honestly, I think it's because we were laughing in choir that we got kicked out. I think you can actually sing. And so she said, yes. It was a shaky, terrified yes, but she said yes. And she invited me to attend the service. So I did. And on the night of the performance, she stood in the back row of the choir clutching her music like it was a parachute. The first notes came and she sang quietly at first and then louder until she was smiling from ear to ear. And by the end, she was belting out that hymn with tears streaming down her face. And later she said, I was scared to death, but saying yes was the best thing I did. I felt like my soul was singing. That's the power of saying yes to something that feels scary. And Mary too said yes to God's call, a call far more daunting than joining a choir. And yet her yes led to deep joy. It led to the Magnificat, to a song that echoed through the generations. It's been used by mothers around the world. The words are so powerful that some governments banned them. Mary's words in Luke 1 are not just praise. They are vocation. You wouldn't be surprised that I'm talking vocation as somebody who's works in it. But her vocation began to the message we often hear in scripture. Do not be afraid. Do not be afraid. When the angel first greets Mary, she's troubled. She wonders what this greeting could mean. But the angel says, do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. That reassurance is the doorway to her Magnificat. Without it, fear might have silenced her song.\n\nBut she says, my soul magnifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour. Mary chooses joy over fear. Her calling begins not with certainty, but with trust. He has looked with favour on the loneliness of his servant. Mary was ordinary, but she was chosen. Fear could have told her that she was too small, too insignificant. But vocation is not about status, it's about faithfulness. So it began with trust, it continued with faithfulness. He has brought down the powerful from their thrones and lifted up the lowly. That's the bit government's banned. He has brought down the powerful from their thrones and lifted up the lowly. Vocation is transformative. Fear says it's too risky. Faith says do not be afraid, God is with you. And I think that's echoed in the psalm we heard this morning from Psalm 90. The psalm prays, may the favour of the Lord our God rest on us, prosper the work of our hands for us. Yes, prosper the work of our hands. Well isn't that exactly what Mary sings in the Magnificat? God has looked with favour on her lowliness. God has established, prospered the work of her hands. Not just in raising a child, but in bearing Christ into the world. And when we say yes to our vocations, God establishes the work of our hands too. Whether it's in classrooms, kitchens, hospitals or fields, our labour becomes part of God's eternal story. Psalm 90 ends with a prayer for joy. Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days. Well Mary's Magnificat is that song of joy. And our vocations, when rooted in God's love, become songs of joy too. Even when they are small, even when we think they're ordinary, they magnify the Lord. You might think, well I don't know if I have a vocation. We absolutely do, every single one of us. It could be to be a listening ear to a friend. It could be to do the washing up in the kitchen. It could be to do a very long walk on a pilgrimage. Or it even could be to licensed or ordained ministry. Mary's Magnificat is a song of courage. It's the sound of someone who heard, do not be afraid, and believed it. And that same message is spoken to us. Do not be afraid. Each one of us has a calling to live out our faith, to love and serve God. A gift that we've been given. My friend Jane, who's a priest in Wales, said her vocation began by washing up in the kitchen. She said yes to going on the coffee and tea rota. In retirement, she was called to go deeper. To pray deeper. To walk alongside others. Every act we do for God is a step in our journey of vocation. Let me tell you about Anna. Anna had always dreamed of teaching. But when the opportunity came, she was terrified. Standing in front of a classroom full of children felt overwhelming. She worried she wasn't good enough. Any of you felt like that before? She felt that she'd fail. That the children wouldn't listen to her. And on her very first day, she told me she remembered the word she heard in church. Do not be afraid. So she took a deep breath. She walked into the classroom. And she said yes to the calling God had placed on her to be a teacher. It wasn't perfect. Some days were noisy. Some lessons fell flat. But slowly she discovered joy. She saw a child's eye light up when they understood a maths problem. She heard laughter when a story came alive. And she realised that her vocation wasn't about being flawless, but about being faithful. Anna's story is the Magnificat in its own way. Her soul magnifies the Lord every time she encourages a child. Each time she chooses patience over frustration. Each time she says yes to the vocation God has given her. And in her story, Psalm 90's prayer is established. Establish the work of our hands. Let the work of our hands prosper. And as a final thought, Mary's Magnificat is a song of vocation. Her trembling yet courageous yes to God's call. She magnifies the Lord not only in her words, but in her life. Becoming a mother to a saviour and king. The musical journey to Bethlehem. Have any of you seen that musical? No? It's not the most biblically accurate, but it does do something about explaining the feelings that Mary and Joseph might have had. And it captures this moment in the song, Mother to a Saviour and King. In it, Mary's voice, she talks about her fear a bit. She talks about her wonder. And she's asked this question, why do you see a mother to a saviour and king? It's a song of humility, of awe, and ultimately of faith. The same emotions that we might feel when God calls us. And she says this, help me to have the faith you have in me, as she steps into that vocation. Help me to have the faith you have in me. And she asks God how she can carry Jesus when she needs carrying herself. It's that trembling yes, even when we're scared. Remembering that do not be afraid, it starts with trust, it continues in faithfulness. So we're going to listen to this song now. And I would ask you to let it be more than just music. Let it be a prayer, a reminder that in our vocations, whether in teaching or being a good friend, listening, to praying, to washing up in the kitchen, whatever we hear the nudge to do, and if it's a nudge to explore licensed or ordained ministry, nabble me at the back because I'd be delighted to hear from you. What's God nudging you to this morning? What's that fearful, trembling yes that you're called to? But at the same time, that whisper starts in your heart. Do not be afraid, for I have redeemed you. I have called you by name, and you are mine. What's that yes? That's it."

    "transcript": "The Bible reading can be found in Mark chapter 1, and we're reading verses 1 to 11, and it can be found on page 35 of your Pew Bibles, or on the screen. The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. As it is written in the prophet Isaiah, See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way. The voice of one crying out in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his path straight. John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And people from the whole Judean countryside, and all the people of Jerusalem, were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the River Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. He proclaimed, The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me. I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals. I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart, and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, You are my Son, the Beloved. With you I am well pleased. This is the word of the Lord. Great, thank you Rachel for reading for us. And it's a pleasure to be with you this morning. As Gemma said, my name is Julian, and along with Caroline, my wife, we usually worship with the 9 o'clock service. Although, of course, in a few weeks' time we'll be all together and seeing more of each other, I'm sure. Before I start, why don't we pray? Our Father God, I pray that you would take these words of mine, and by your Spirit, use them to speak to each one of us. I pray that you would encourage us, strengthen us, and grow us into the likeness of your Son, Jesus Christ. Amen. When the historians of the 22nd century look back on these times of ours, I wonder what they will call them. It could be the age of anxiety. Last year, the American psychiatrist Jonathan Haidt published a book on the desperately high levels of emotional distress and mental ill health among young people. He called it The Anxious Generation. Haidt pins the blame on social media, but stir into the mix the environmental crisis, the technological revolution, the pandemic, spiralling debt, economic stagnation, and rumours of war with Russia. And who is surprised that people today are anxious? If, like me, you sometimes wonder whether there will ever be a 22nd century to look back from, it kind of underlines the point. So what is it that makes you anxious? I guess that for most of us, our anxieties are much more personal. It's ironic, isn't it, that as we prepare for Christmas, which is when we celebrate peace on earth, we should find the preparations so stressful. For some of us, it's the daunting prospect of noisy parties and difficult family reunions. For others, the consciousness of loss and the dread of loneliness. For some, it's worries about whether the money will stretch far enough. For others, the challenge of figuring out what on earth do you give the man who already has everything. So here's my question this morning. At times of anxiety, in an age of anxiety, how can we stand out as people of peace? I don't just mean being peacemakers between others. I mean, how can we be people who are fundamentally, through and through, at peace? At peace with God, at peace with others, at peace with our situation, at peace with ourselves. In our Bible reading from Mark, I think we find some answers to that question. If we look closely, we'll see three things. We'll see that Jesus makes peace comprehensively, that he gives his peace abundantly, and perhaps surprisingly, we'll see that peace comes through penitence. Those are our three points this morning, and you may find it helpful to have Mark's Gospel open in front of you, chapter 1, page 35 of the Church Bibles. Firstly then, Jesus makes peace comprehensively. The opening verses of Mark's Gospel introduce the life of Jesus with a massive claim. Jesus of Nazareth, Mark tells us, was confirmed by Almighty God to be the fulfillment of all the hopes of Israel. So John the Baptist walks onto the scene as the quintessential prophet. Just like the great prophet Elijah, he lives in the wild and he wears the same clothes. Just like you can tell Gemma is the vicar, you can still tell that Gemma is the vicar because she's still got her dog collar on. When she's got her robes on, you definitely know that Gemma is the vicar in the same way you can tell that John is a prophet because he's wearing Elijah's clothes. But more than Elijah, he represents the beginning, the end, and the middle of Israel's story. That's there in verses 2 to 4. See, I'm sending my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way. The voice of one crying out in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. That's a composite of three references. First, there's the messenger of God, the angel who went before the people of Israel in Exodus 23 to guide them into the promised land. And then very quickly, Mark connects that image of the messenger of God to Malachi 3 where we find another messenger, the messenger of the covenant, who will announce the return of God to the temple at Jerusalem. To purify the people of Israel forever. And then he lands the biggest quote in the middle with this voice we find in Isaiah 40, a voice that announces to the people of God that their time of exile in Babylon is over. The glory of God is about to be revealed to the whole world. So John the Baptist is all of these prophecies rolled into one. He represents the whole of the Old Testament and he pulls it together and he points it at Jesus. If he is the angel of God, Jesus is our promised land, a place of freedom, not slavery. A place flowing with abundance, milk and honey, grapes and figs, fine wheat, rich wine. A place where the poor, the widow, the alien and the orphan are cared for. Where everyone is satisfied. If John is the messenger of the covenant, Jesus must be the one who fills the temple with his glory. Who purifies a people to worship him in truth. If John is the voice in the wilderness, Jesus is the one who ends our exile, our alienation and estrangement from God. Jesus is the one who brings shalom, that Hebrew word meaning holistic\n\nthick peace and well-being, the peace that Israel hoped for and which we all long for. Jesus brings peace comprehensively. And in case you're not convinced by John, Mark tells us that this massive claim was confirmed by God with a double witness. Verses 9 to 11. Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan, and just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, You are my Son, the Beloved. When Jesus is baptized by John, the Spirit descends and there's a voice from above. Old Testament law required two witnesses in evidence of any claim. Here we have them, the Spirit and the Father confirming the identity of the Son. And Mark tells us that when that happens, the heavens were torn apart. It's a very distinctive word. We've got to think of ripping an old bed sheet in half. It's a very satisfying feeling, isn't it? It's torn from top to bottom. And it turns up just once more in Mark's Gospel. In Mark 15, you may think of it at the point of Jesus' death, the temple curtain is torn from top to bottom. The barrier between God and us has been ripped apart. Heaven has been thrown open. No more sacrifice. No more complex ritual. Nothing. We are at one with God. He has made peace. And like the dove returning to Noah, announcing that the floodwaters of God's judgment had subsided, carrying an olive branch, showing that new life was springing up, so the peace-bringing, life-giving Spirit of God rests upon Jesus. Jesus makes peace comprehensively. And secondly, we see that Jesus gives his peace abundantly. John offered his baptism to everyone. We read there in verse 4 and 5, he appeared in the wilderness proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, and people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him. It's obviously an exaggeration, but it makes the point. This baptism, this offer, is for everyone. And of course, this baptism that John provided wasn't just some symbolic sprinkling like we have in church. Nowadays, it was a total immersion in water, right under the water, to symbolize complete washing, complete purification. But then John says, verse 7, the one who is more powerful than I is coming after me. I'm not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals. I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. This baptism that John offers as a sign of repentance, of confession, is nothing compared to Jesus. Jesus is so powerful, so great, that compared to him, John is not even up to the status of the bottommost servant or slave. Think about it. Untying someone's sandals after a hot and sticky walk across a dusty land was unpleasant and socially demeaning. It meant you were the bottom of the pile. And John, who is all the prophets of God rolled into one, John, who is the greatest of all the Old Testament prophets, says, I am less than the bottom of the pile when it comes to Jesus. Why? Because I only baptize with water, but he will baptize you with the Spirit of God himself. Not just some symbolic sprinkling, complete and total immersion, drenched, soaked through in the peace-bringing, life-giving Spirit of God. Do you see the claim that Mark is making here? It's massive. Jesus takes all these Old Testament promises, all those centuries of longing and hoping for shalom, for comprehensive peace, and he tips them over us. A great cascade of living water. What we are promised here is a totally different order of spiritual experience. Jesus makes peace comprehensively. He gives his peace abundantly. So come back down to earth. Why do I have so little of that peace? How can I get more of it? And the answer that this passage suggests is perhaps a little surprising. Peace becomes personal through penitence. When John prepares people to receive Jesus, when he promises the future baptism in the Holy Spirit, he calls them to repentance. There in verses 4 and 5, a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, and people came out to him confessing their sins. We tend to think of this, don't we, as a picture of how we become Christians in the first place. How do you become a Christian? Repentance and faith, symbolized in baptism. But repentance is not simply a one-off event. It's a fundamental principle of spiritual maturity. For a long time, I used to think that confession involved calling to mind all the wrong things I had thought, said, or done recently, saying sorry, wiping the slate clean, and starting again. Now that's not exactly wrong, but it's seriously inadequate. It's actually quite dangerous because it risks becoming legalistic or pharisaical. What do I mean? It implies that basically I am okay, but that occasionally I muck up and that needs dealing with, and then I'm okay again. And I don't know about you, but when we come to the time of confession in church, I often struggle to think of anything concrete that I have done wrong in the last few days. Mind goes blank. And that really does risk turning me into a Pharisee because then confession in church becomes the time in the service when I'm encouraged to discover that I really am quite a good person after all. Confession is something much bigger, much more important. As Luther insisted, he was absolutely right. We are at the same time right with God and sinners through and through. We're at the same time right with God and sinners through and through. Confession is the systematic acknowledgement of and sorrow for, lament over all the ways I and the world I find myself in fall short of God's loving purposes for me. All the ways I am less than what he calls me to be. It's a deliberate emptying out of myself so that I can be filled by him. So confession starts with truth-telling. Truth-telling about the world in all its brokenness and alienation from God. If you're short of material, look at the news. And that should move us to lament the way God is dishonored and people get hurt. And then we place ourselves into that picture as those who are caught up in patterns of thought and behavior which are less than loving, less than holy, less than good. This isn't primarily about assigning blame. You see, we are all onlookers of sin, victims of sin, and perpetrators of sin. The wonderful thing is that we don't need to disentangle that. We can confess all of that complex mess so that we're ready to receive. When I was a boy, I used to tidy up my toy cupboard on Christmas Eve. It became quite a sort of personal ritual for me. And I would get everything out.\n\nOnto the bedroom floor, lay it all out, throw out anything that was half broken, or the outgrown bits and bobs, the experiments of six months ago that didn't quite come to anything. Get rid of it all, and then I put everything that was valuable and worth keeping back in the cupboard, nice and tidily. And I did all that not because I was a particularly virtuous child, I don't think I was ever told to do it, I simply wanted to make space for all the new presents I was about to get. When we repent, we empty ourselves out, we dispose of the rubbish so that we may be filled. How can I expect to be full of the Holy Spirit if I am full of myself? Penitence unlocks all the fruit of the Holy Spirit, but it particularly speaks into this question of inner peace. Why? Because so many of my anxieties can be traced back either to too big a view of myself or too small a view of God. I expect too much of myself, and I expect too little of him. Remember what John the Baptist said elsewhere in John 3? He must become greater, I must become less. So here's an example, I might be worrying about a new lecture that I'm going to give next week. So I think, well what exactly am I worried about? It just might not go well, it creates anxiety in my mind. Sure, I want to do a good job, I want the students to enjoy the lecture, I want them to learn from it, those are all great, that's good motives. What really makes me anxious is the thought that I might not do it very well. And what really makes me anxious, really, really, is the thought that students might leave the lecture thinking, ah you know that guy, he's not very good, he's not very good at lecturing. They go out saying he's useless, don't know why we bothered going, won't go to the next one. That's what's freaking me out, and that's pride. So I can confess the pride that underlies that anxiety, I can be released by God from it, set free to do the best I can and leave my reputation up to him. Or I might worry about my health, and sure sickness and illness and death are marks of the brokenness of this world. They're not my fault, I'm just caught up in it. But you see the thing is, illness tends to make me grumpy and feel rather sorry for myself. It tends to make me self-focused. And then I doubt God's goodness to me and his care for me. That's me getting caught up in that brokenness. And then I might realise that actually I tend not to care very much about other people's illness and suffering. My own takes over. That's also a mark of my brokenness. And I can lay all of that out before God in all its complexity and messiness. Lament it, confess whatever is of me in it, empty myself of it, and ask him to fill me with his spirit instead. That brings peace. St Augustine was one of the greatest Christian theologians of all time. There are two Augustines, and the one I'm talking about is the 5th century Bishop of North Africa, not the missionary to England and the first Archbishop of Canterbury in the late 6th century. So the first Augustine, Augustine of Hippo, in his Confessions, he famously wrote these words. You may know them. Words about peace. You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in you. On his deathbed as an old man, when Augustine was too weak to move, we're told that he asked for the penitential psalms to be written out and pinned, pinned up where he could read them. And he lay there reading the penitential psalms and weeping until the Lord took him home. I don't think that was a sad experience. I think this was a man who understood that peace becomes personal through penitence. As we dig deeper into confession, so we are opened up more and more to the spirit of God and all the blessings that Christ stands ready to pour out on us. And we will discover that we hear more and more clearly those words at the end of our reading which are spoken also to us who are in Christ. You are my son. You are my daughter. My beloved one. With you I am well pleased. You see to go through each day having bathed, having been baptised in the Father's pleasure is to be a person of great peace. Amen."

    "transcript": "Kiddos, popcorn. You're welcome. Okay, what's going to be the last one to go? Bounty. Bounty. See, if I was choosing, Bounty would be the first to go. Like, this is a white lion bar. Wild card, I'm thinking, on the old white lion bar. Anyway, totally irrelevant. Great to see you all. Say hello to the people sitting around you. Just make sure that you know everybody's names. We're going to have a little moment of discussion today. So just say hello to the people immediately around you, and then we're going to start in about 20 seconds' time. Okay, marvellous. Well done, everybody. Well done, well done. Okay, so hopefully you've had a chance to say hello to those people sat directly around you. Can I tell you the plan for this afternoon? Is that okay? So I did have something completely different prepared to say today, and I changed my mind. So I do a thing, which is an awful thing, which is whenever I speak into a microphone like this and I do a talk, I always go back and listen to it, which is like an exercise in getting the creeps. It's awful, but I think it's important because I want to improve. I want to do better. And so I was listening to my talk from last week, and I was like, that's pretty good, but I did leave something or a few things unresolved, and I found that there was a whole bunch of stuff that I wanted to say that I didn't say, particularly some stuff. I think I set up something like, what does it actually look like to be adopted into God's family? What does it actually look like? And then we went off on a lovely tangent, and it was very emotional, but I didn't actually really talk about what it actually looks like practically to be adopted into God's household. So is that okay? Can we just do a little rewind and go again? Is that okay? Is that all right? Yeah? But that does have the implication that because I did have something written down to say, and I started kind of thinking about this on Wednesday, Thursday this week, so I haven't done as much preparation as I normally would. And so I've got a couple of backups here. You guys are part of my backup plan, and Ben is part of my backup plan. Who's excited? Who's excited? Okay, so this is Ben Britton. Do you want to just introduce yourself? Hello. Thanks to the one person that was excited. Yeah, I was like, whoo! I'm going to aim for two by the end. I'm up for it. Yeah, so I'm Ben. I'm a secondary school teacher, so I think Daniel's wrote to me in because I'm used to standing up and trying to explain things that I haven't prepared for and that I don't fully understand, which sounds like a joke, but it's not. There's too many lessons. Yeah, that is frighteningly accurate. Yeah, so I thought I'd invite Ben to come and speak today because as I mentioned last week, Ben wrote his master's dissertation on the verses that we unpacked last week, and I read Ben's master's to prepare for last week, and so I was kind of like, if I kind of need somebody to come and just give me a hand, Ben would be the obvious choice, and so thank you, Ben, for coming and joining. It's very exciting to have him here. Ben and I both studied at a college called WTC. There are some, thank you, a little bit more enthusiasm for WTC. There's a few people in the room who either work for WTC or have studied with WTC. It's a theological training college where you can basically study theology part-time. If it's something that's interesting to you, their courses are designed for normal people working other jobs. So if you're interested in studying theology, would you come and talk to me because WTC should be your first choice. Yes, amen. Okay, we are thinking about sending some people to WTC next year, September 2026. I'm saying it first here, so if anybody wants to talk to me about that, come and talk to me about that. Anyway, so what we're going to do today is I thought of five things that I can think of that we receive when we are adopted into God's family. Five very practical things. It's not an exhaustive list, and we won't have time to do all five of them today, but there are five chocolate bars here. And so this is how this is going to work today. If you would like to earn one of these chocolate bars, then you may come and grab one when I say so, not before, okay? You've been eyeing these all Sunday, so not before. You can come and grab one, and if you do, then I'm just going to simply ask you to read into this microphone a little scripture, and then Ben and I are going to unpack it really quickly, and then we're going to move on. Well, how do we think? Does that sound good? Okay, that's the plan. So quickly, before we do, is there anybody here a Charles Dickens fan? One, two, three, four, five, six. Yeah, a handful, handful. So one of my Christmas traditions is read a Charles Dickens book by the fire at Christmas time. It's fabulous. If you've never done it, this is the year. Get yourself a copy of A Christmas Carol. Find yourself a fireplace and a cozy chair and go reading through it. No, the film does not count. You have to read the book. Go and read through a Dickens book. The Muppet film. It's a good film. It's a good film, but it doesn't count. You've got to read the book. Jim Kitten. No, not the Jim Carrey film. Absolutely not. Another classic Dickens book is Oliver Twist. Anybody here know the story of Oliver Twist? Oliver. Oliver. Diddly diddly diddly dee. Classic tale of a boy who gets adopted, right? And we're talking over the last Sundays about being adopted by God. And so this story of Oliver Twist has been high in my mind. It's about a little boy who's born into poverty who kind of falls in with the wrong crowd and has to work really hard to find his way in life. He eventually gets himself adopted by Mr. Brownlow and learns a new way of living. And then there's those moments where he's kind of drawn back into his old life with Fagin. Got to pick a pocket or two, boy. And there's that tension between his old life and his new life, his old life and his new adopted life. And what I want us to do as we explore this afternoon is just keep that story in the forefront of our minds. Try not to get too distracted by little scenes of little boys going, please, sir, can I have some more? But we're going to think about how does it look when God adopts us into his family? How do we benefit? And we're going to be thinking about Oliver Twist a little bit along as we go. How does that sound? I said I'd look at you like pregnantly. Go on, say something. What I want to say is how do I get a chocolate bar? That's my first question. I'll give you one afterwards. If you waffle on for long enough. That's what you said last time. Yeah, that's true. No, the thing that occurs to me about Oliver Twist is that he is still himself and whichever environment he was part of was going to affect him. So if he was around criminals, that was going to affect him negatively. And hopefully Mr. Brownlow wasn't perfect, but that part of the metaphor makes sense to me. You are welcome as you are and you get to be who you are, but also let's work on that stuff together, like the anxiety or the addictions or whatever it is that we struggle with. Let's work on those things so you can be yourself, but also let's be transformed as we're part of God's family. Come on, worth the price of admission already. Very good. Okay, who wants to go first? Who wants the first chocolate bar? Just come and take it. Don't put your hand up, just come and take it. Come and take it. Oh, Theo's done it. Well done. Okay, Theo, well done. What did we take? A Yorkie? Great choice. I respect that. Right, here's your reading. Can you read it like it's alive, please? Sorry? Read it like it's alive and it's true, okay? Go for it. Either way, Christ's love controls us. Since we believe that Christ died for all, we also believe that we have all died to our old life. He died for everyone so that those who receive his new life will no longer live for themselves. Instead, they will live for Christ, who died and was raised for them. So we have stopped evaluating others from a human point of view. At one time we thought of Christ merely of a human point of view. How differently we know him now. This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone, a new life has begun. Amen, come on. Thanks, Theo. You may now sit down. Thank you very much. So the first thing that we receive when we are adopted by God is a fresh start. So Oliver was born into poverty and his story was defined by a search for home, a search for family, a search for provision, and basically asking the question, how can I live a good life? And he finds all sorts of options for how he can do his best. But it's only when he encounters Mr. Brownlow that he finds true safety and security. Now if and when we choose to say yes to Jesus, we get that same opportunity. We leave our old life behind and we begin a new one. One thing that really\n\nYou can think about that as going from bad to good, right? Living with criminals, not being fed properly, being beaten, bad, I would argue. Mr. Brownlow, good. But something we miss sometimes is that Oliver's life went from being difficult to being easy, and that's not the deal with us. So if you are living your life for God, instead we'll live for Christ. That is tough. So if you would call yourself a Christian and you're finding it easy, then I'm not sure you're doing it right. And that's a bit harsh, isn't it? So I couldn't think of a nice way to say it, but it's tough. And joining a new family would be really difficult, and that transformation is hard. But I think it's worth it. Sorry, I'm skipping ahead. You're going to say this later, aren't you? It doesn't matter, say it now. But that was, yeah. Great. Okay, who wants a chocolate bar? Steve, well done. Oh, he's gone for the white lion. We respect that, we respect that. Okay, here we go. You can borrow my microphone as well, because that one's going to misbehave. That one's going to work now? Okay, go. God, for whom and through whom everything was made, chose to bring many children into glory. And it was only right that he should make Jesus, through his suffering, a perfect leader, fit to bring them into their salvation. So now Jesus and the ones he makes holy have the same father. That's why Jesus is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters. For he said to God, I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters. I will praise you among your assembled people. He also said, I will put my trust in him. That is, I and the children God has given me. Brilliant, thank you, Steve. Claim your prize. Well done. Thank you, sir. Noted. Noted, thank you. I feel reprimanded, personally. Man alive, that's thrown me off. So in the story of Oliver, Oliver didn't receive new siblings. He did receive a new family, but he didn't receive siblings. But when we come into God's family, we do receive siblings. I can remember when I used to go to a youth festival when I was a kid called Soul Survivor. And there used to be moments each year when people would go to the front to give their lives to Jesus, to say yes to Jesus, to say I want to come into the family of God. And they'd pray this prayer with them. And then the guy who was leading would say, oh, well, I've got some really bad news. Turn around, and everybody waved at them. And he went, these guys are now your brothers and sisters. And whilst that's a little bit cheesy, it's also true. Like if we have the same father, like that passage in Hebrew encourages us to believe, then we are now siblings. When we are saved and adopted, we enter into an up-down relationship with God the Father, but we also enter into a left-right relationship with our brothers and sisters as well. It's interesting to note that family familial language is the most common language that Paul, who wrote so much of our New Testaments, used. He was constantly saying, dear brothers and sisters to us. Has anyone ever come across that when they're reading Paul? He'll say, dear brothers and sisters. Like he's not doing that by accident. He's doing that on purpose because that's how he thinks about churches like ours and families like ours. You say some things now. Okay. The brothers and sisters thing, I think two things happen for me when I read that. One is I think of my brother and my two sisters. And frankly, I don't have a good relationship with them. If I didn't contact them, I would only see them at funerals and on Boxing Day. Which again sounds like a joke, but it's not really. So for those of us with those negative connotations, there's that level to try and remove. And then the other one is brothers and sisters becomes just a thing we say to each other. And it loses any impact. And this is one thing where going back into the context is helpful. And I know I've said the word context. Try to stay with me because that's a boring word that boring people say. But I think it's helpful because at the time this was written, your siblings would have been extremely important because by your 20s, most people, your parents are dead. You live in a small community. You can't be friends with people outside of your class. So there's very few people you can be friends with. So your brothers and sisters, that was an extremely important relationship that you needed. So when Paul says that to us, he's saying, this is a big relationship. This is something where you can rely on each other, where you can ask for help. And that's a tough one, right? Like, who likes asking for help? I don't. I'm sort of unhappy that I've got a chocolate bar. I'm happy, but I'm also like, now I feel bad and it brings up all sorts of things. And it's tricky. But that's sort of... I know, see, it's complicated, isn't it? It's difficult. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But this is real. This is what it's like. If it was about... I think there was an chocolate bar. We could have an actual... We're going to fall out with each other, right? We're going to disagree. And that means that there's real stuff happening. If everything is always like, oh, hi, how are you doing? That's not what I'm here for. If you're here for that, that's great. But, yeah. I think this is a really interesting one. When we think of the people sitting around us as our brothers and sisters, I think it challenges something which is really difficult about church at the moment. I think there's so much about church in the West which is very consumeristic as that kind of, what can I get? What can I get? What can I get? When we look around and think of the people sitting around us as our brothers and sisters, then really that's kind of the wrong question to ask. When we look around ourselves, we should be asking, well, what do you need? How can I serve you? How can I love you? In the way that I would naturally respond in love to my blood sibling, then that's the way that we should be thinking about those sitting around us. And I think it's also challenging when we expand that thinking and think about people from other churches who also follow Jesus. Or particularly when we think about people from around the world who right now are being persecuted because of their faith or living in extreme, extreme poverty. If we truly think about those people as our brothers and sisters, how would we respond if our blood relations were living in persecution? How would we respond if our blood relations, the people that we were raised with, the people that we just love because we love because they're part of our family, were living in abject poverty? How would we respond? We would do something about that. We would care. That would bother us. And I'm speaking to myself here. This has convicted me this week. I can very easily turn a blind eye to that. But if I take Jesus' words serious here and think of those people as my brothers and sisters, that challenges my consumerism in quite an uncomfortable way, if I'm honest. What are you looking at? We're going to stop for a moment of discussion now. So why don't you turn to the people around you and just literally for one minute or two minutes just kick that idea around. That idea of having brothers and sisters both in this room, in different churches, but also around the world. How does that resonate with you? We're just going to do this for one or two minutes and then we're going to be straight back again. Go. Okay, who wants to read next? Me. But don't put your hand up. Grab a chocolate. Oh, crikey. He's taken the whole lectern with you. Okay, well done. Okay, let's find out the third thing that we gain when we are adopted by God. For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord. So live as people of light, for this light within you produces only what is good and right and true. Carefully determine what pleases the Lord. Take no path in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness. Instead expose them. Thanks, Lil. Thank you very much. Brilliant. Oh, thanks. Thanks so much for that. Okay, so this is a crunchy one. Who wants a crunchy one? Nobody wants a crunchy one. One of the things that we receive when we're adopted into the family of God is discipline. Who's with me? We come into a new family and this family has different ways of doing things. And the point is that if we have a decent father, if we have a decent father figure who's engaged in our lives, one of the things that he will do with us as a decent father is to bring some discipline into our lives. We see this really clearly in Oliver's story. He comes out of a life of crime and poverty and into a life of wealth and order. And in order to make his life work in those surroundings, he had to learn new habits, learn new ways of living. He had to take off old ways and put on new ways. Like behaving how he used to was completely out of the question. He had to behave in the ways that made sense within Mr. Brownlow's house. Can you imagine if he had still gone out and picked pockets every now and again like he used to when he was with Fagan? It's like, no, he's part of a new family now. The old has gone and a new has come. Let's face it, none of us like discipline. It's awful, right?\n\nIt's like, I can't do it. I won't do it. And I had to come face to face with my own sense of self-importance, my own pride, my arrogance. And I felt like I had to walk through that in order for God to bring about something more beautiful in my life. And I've had to do that again multiple times over the years. But that's an example in my life of where God has brought discipline into my life. It was uncomfortable at all. But it was in order to produce something good within me. And I think one of the things I was thinking about was that sense of being each other challenge. And one thing that I really value from Daniel is that most weeks he will challenge us. And that comes from a place of love. And because we all just mess up all the time. If we played who's got something wrong this week instead of what's God been doing this week, we'd have to start quite early, wouldn't we? So I think bringing that challenge and bringing it in love because it's really easy to be like, oh yeah, that's fine and just be nice. But sometimes it's grace and truth, isn't it? Jesus was full of both. We struggle with that. As you might be able to tell already, I lean on the truth side. Apologies. You should meet my mum. But I think as churches often lean on the grace side and that's right. If you're honestly being loving, bring that challenge to someone that you know well enough because we all need that. That's important. And that's part of discipline, I think. Yeah, and I think I'm aware that we could probably take a whole afternoon talking about this. And so I'm sorry to just kind of dip in and out of it. But one of the things I think, because different ones of us, we've all had different experiences of discipline. And I know obviously it's a hot potato for anybody who's thought about parenting recently. Like, it's a hot potato. So like, let's just acknowledge that. All of us have our own experience of that. But what this comes down to, I think, is it challenges our deep core beliefs about is God good or not? Is he a good father or not? If he's good and if he's a good father and if we can trust him, if he chooses to bring discipline into our lives, that's a good thing, right? Because he knows us better, deeper than we know ourselves. He has a perspective on our lives that we just don't have. So if we find ourselves in a difficult and uncomfortable moment, if we feel like God is asking us to do something that we don't want to do and it's going to be hard for us or there seems to be some kind of limitation being imposed on us, like, it's a moment of maturity, isn't it, for us to go, okay, Lord, I believe you're doing something. I don't like it. I don't see everything, but I believe that you're a good, good father. And so, like, let's do this. And I think crucially, that's where the sibling bit comes in as well. Like, that's where it's really important for us to have our brothers and sisters because then we can go to them in our home group and be like, this is what's going on. It's so frustrating. And as brothers and sisters, we can be like, okay, well, like, what's God speaking to you at the moment? Like, how is this challenging the way that you think about God? Like, how can I pray for you? Let's pray it through together. Like, I'm not trying to make out that this is simple or easy. It's not. It's really uncomfortable. Like, one of the verses I was going to put in here was from Hebrews, which says, like, no one enjoys discipline at the time. Like, of course we don't. But it is, it does bring out goodness. It brings out good fruit in us. And it's about maturity. It's about growing up before we grow old. So, yeah. I'm just looking at the time and I'm aware that the kiddos are going to come back in at any minute. So we've got two, what have we got? We've got a bounty. Who wants the bounty? Yeah, Bridgie, it's yours. Hey, left-handed throw. Who wants that one? Yes, Ben, you've waited patiently. There you go. What we're going to do is just to close off our time together is I want us to get back into those little groups that we were just discussing in. And I want us to pray for each other in the same way that we would in a home group setting. So just share if one of those three things has been particularly poignant to you, if anything's stood out to you, if anything is particularly challenging to you. So you can share those things if you feel comfortable to. Or you can pray for one another as well. If you're really not sure what to pray for and it's a little bit awkward in your group, then pray for Christians around the world who are living in poverty or who are particularly persecuted. We're going to do that just for a couple of minutes until the kiddos come back in again. And then at that point, Ryan will take over and we will hear from the kiddos, we'll sing one more song, and we will celebrate communion together. But why don't we just find ourselves back in those little groups? Let's have a little conversation. Oh, and there won't be another opportunity. So can we say thanks to Ben? Who brought so much of today. Wasn't that great? Yeah, let's get into those little groups and then the kiddos will come in and join us. So yeah, let's go for it. Let's dive in. Let's pray for each other."

    "transcript": "It takes more than that to embarrass me, so thank you very much. Hello. I'm just going to go straight in. Actually, I'm just going to pray for a minute. I'm not feeling amazing today, as you might be able to hear. So, let's pray for Jesus' help. Father God, we thank you for your church. We thank you for the way that you love us and you speak in and through us. Would you meet us here today? That we may get to know and love you more. Through all of the things, through cake and through worship and through conversation and through opening your word. Holy Spirit, would you come and would you fill us now? Amen. So, when I was little, the window from my dad's study looked directly up and down the road that I lived on. And from it, you could see the corner shop and the hairdressers and the primary school across the road. And crucially, you could watch any and every car that came down our road with great clarity. And every now and then, we would have family or friends who would be coming to our house for the day. We had a few friends and family who we would only see once or twice a year. But when we did, it was super exciting. And me and my siblings would often kind of pile into my dad's study, climb onto his windowsill. And we would like kneel at the window looking down the road, waiting for our friends to come. And we'd kind of turn around and be like, mum, what colour's their car? She'd be like, red? Because every car in the 90s was red. And we would be watching for every red car that would come down the road. And we'd go, is that one it? Oh, no, it's driven past. Is that one it? Oh, no, it's driven past. And we would start again. And until eventually, the red car came down the road, slowed down as it came, indicated to go into our little lay-by bit, and then came and our friends were here. And what joy prevailed. Prevailed? Is that the right word? I'll take it. Sometimes mum didn't know the colour of the car, or they'd got a new one in the past year. I know. And we would have this little like frisson of excitement when suddenly they were at our house, and we weren't even aware that they had arrived. Sometimes they came from the opposite direction that we couldn't see. And the next thing we know, there's a ding dong at the door behind us. And we'd be like, they are. We didn't even know. And sometimes we would just be waiting for ages, because we knew that we would be expecting them around lunchtime, which is the most helpless thing to say to a bunch of kids. It was before the time of mobile phones or location sharing or ETA updates. I know some of you can't believe I'm that old, but I am. And so from like 11.30, we would sit and we would wait and we'd look out the window, kind of itching and impatient, wanting the good thing to happen, wanting our friends to arrive. Knowing that they said they would at some point, but not quite knowing when. And sometimes they'd be delayed because of traffic or motorways or party training or whatever it was. But we would wait. Me and my siblings would wait in anticipation of the joy of their expected arrival. And I thought that's what we'd look at today. Waiting. Yes. Because today marks the beginning of Advent. Give me a hands up here. Who has ever engaged with the season of Advent in some way? Okay. Some people. Who's never even heard of Advent before? Oh, you'll get a point. Anyone heard of it but not really sure what it is or what it's for or what it means? Yeah, a few people. So Advent is the time in the church calendar that leads up to Christmas, a bit like Lent leads up to Easter. So where Lent leads us to look at Jesus' time in the desert and facing temptation and kind of encourages us to engage with our desert places or our response to temptation, Advent leads us to look at the Israelite nation in the Old Testament who were waiting and preparing for a promised Messiah. And Advent encourages us to engage with our times of waiting and to consider what it's like to live a life with anticipated hope, preparing for what's not quite here yet. And I know that there are many of us here today who are waiting. Waiting for a whole variety of things. Waiting for certain relationships. Waiting for a certain family setup. Waiting for healing, maybe in their body. Waiting for healing, maybe in their mind. Waiting for clarity. Waiting for an end or a beginning. Waiting for opportunity. And in a culture that, despite our aptitude for queuing, doesn't actually have to wait that much. You know, most things can be delivered or communicated pretty instantly. The question is then, if we are waiting and we are longing for something that isn't happening now or instantly or easily at all, how do we inhabit that space well? And if you're sitting there going, I'm not waiting for anything, then the question then becomes, how do we then walk well beside those who are? Because we are brothers and sisters and this is what community does. If we are not waiting but someone next to us is waiting, then we are waiting. And so, we're going to take just a minute to break some ice, chat to a couple of people around you, to three, four, however many you fancy, to be honest, I'm not going to hold you to account. And answer me this, what's the most annoying thing to wait for? Is it the swirly, like, scrolly, doom screen thing? Is it buffering on a video? Is it dinner time? Is it a bus? Go, you've got two minutes. Okey-dokey, all right. I would love to hear some things. And if you agree with that is an annoying thing to wait for, I want to hear you groan or make some sort of noise to agree. So, who wants to kick us off? What's the most annoying? Yes, Pip, what's the most annoying thing to wait for? People you know are going to be late, but you don't know how late. Yes. Classic. Anyone else? Shaz. Annoying to wait for people who never show up. All right, I agree. Ben. A&E. Oh, the wait to see a healthcare professional. I apologise on behalf of the NHS. Charlotte. One of the things about me is waiting, waiting, waiting for somebody like a social worker or an official government person. Yeah, so waiting for a service to be provided, essentially. Yes, I hear you. Absolutely. Ryan. Waiting in traffic. Surprised this didn't come up earlier. We've got a few people in traffic. Okay, I want two more. Waiting for food, just always. Whether it's cooking or being delivered or your... Yeah, all food is annoying to wait for food. And then we had one over here. Waiting for doctor's appointments. Again. Apologies. It's not my fault. That's not a thing. So, I know. Waiting for your dad to bring you a snack. Right? Yeah, I agree. Waiting for school to finish. Yes. Waiting for the end of term. As we mentioned earlier, Advent is this time of waiting and preparation at Christmas, ahead of Christmas. And it leads us to look at the Israelite nation who were waiting. And they were waiting for the fulfillment of God's promise to them, the promise of a Messiah and a rescuer. So, I thought we would read a bit about this promise today in the book of 2 Samuel in the Old Testament in chapter 7. God speaks through a prophet to King David, who was the king of the Israelite nation, God's chosen people. And he says this. Furthermore, the Lord declares that he will make a house for you, a dynasty of kings. For when you die and are buried with your ancestors, I will raise up one of your descendants, your own offspring, and I will make his kingdom strong. He is the one who will build a house, a temple for my name, and I will secure his royal throne forever. From... Oh, we'll get a whoop. Yes, absolutely a whoop for the promise of God. From this moment, the Israelite... Well, and previously, but in this moment, the Israelites were living in the waiting time of this promise. Over the centuries that followed, they were experiencing all the world of warfare and corrupt leaders and oppression and exile, and they were waiting for a king to come and to save them from\n\nat all, to make their nation a royal nation, a secure nation whose kingdom will last forever. Now, we now know that that anticipated king, the descendant of David, was Jesus. Absolutely. If in doubt, the answer is Jesus. The story we retell and we celebrate at Christmas is exactly this, the fulfillment of the promise given to King David and the nation of Israel. And we read more prophecies in the book of Isaiah about this coming king. We read the next bit which says, and many of us will recognize this from our Christmas time, it says, for a child is born to us, a son is given, the government will be on his shoulders and he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. His government and its peace will never end. He will rule with fairness and justice from the throne of his ancestor David for all eternity. Amen. Some of us, as I said, might recognize this from readings over Christmas time over the years. And this is because, as we've said, the promised king, the long awaited rescuer comes at Christmas in Jesus. And so we are now living in the aftermath of that promise fulfilled in Jesus. But if you've been living in the world for five minutes, you'll know that there isn't always that fairness, that justice, there isn't always that peace. And that's because we are living in the in-between time of two big promises. So the first in the Old Testament was the promise of the lineage of the Israelite nation producing a rescuing king who would rule and reign. And Jesus comes and he kickstarts that kingdom. He absolutely, he turns the tide and trailblazes a new way of living. And with Jesus comes a second promise that Isaiah does give us a glimpse of, but which we can read about in the New Testament in the last book of our Bibles. We read in the book of Revelation, it says this, the second promise described. It says, I heard a loud shout from the throne saying, look, God's home is now among his people. He will live with them. So I'm not feeling too great and I'm really tired. So apparently all my emotions are at the forefront and this is wonderful. God's home is now among his people. He will live with them and they will be his people. God himself will be with them. He will wipe every tear from their eyes and there will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain. All these things are gone forever. And the one sitting on the throne said, look, I'm making everything new. And then he said to me, write this down for what I'm telling you is trustworthy and true. And he said, it is finished. I am the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end. To all who are thirsty, I will give freely from the springs of the water of life. All who are victorious will inherit all these blessings. I will be their God and they will be my children. Amen. Because this, this is our promise. In choosing to follow Jesus, we pick up the mantle from the Israelite nation and we move into the next chapter where we live in the tension of seeing glimpses of the kingdom here and now, seeing a move of God through Jesus's followers and through Holy Spirit, and yet still sometimes living with that longing and unmet desires. But with the expectant hope that he will come again to establish his rule and his reign in its entirety. And that's where we're at, isn't it? Okay, weird place to be. As we wait in this moment, in between these two times, we get to engage with our historical story with that Israelite nation. We can identify ourselves with this community who had this deep longing for freedom and for new life, this community who were waiting, maybe like we are too. We identify ourselves with this community, the Israelite nation, who had to wait for a really, really long time for their promised hope to be fulfilled. But this is why Advent is a wonderful time if you've never engaged with it before, because we can find solace in our own story. Many of us have a fair bit of agency to actually take charge of our life and kind of help ourselves and do all the right things to solve a thing that means that we don't have to wait. We go to the doctors, good. We go to see therapists, we read the books, we do the exercises, we learn to breathe. We are legitimately doing all the right things. I wonder how many of us can identify with this. Over the years, I have really struggled with sleep being a regular and wonderful companion of mine, or not. And over the years, I have done all of the right things for my prayer to be heard, for the waiting for a consistent stretch run of good night's sleep to be. So I usually, good sleep evades me basically. One and a half to two and a half hours a night, or over 50% of the time, I'll be awake and I'll wake up early before my alarm, which goes off at six already, which is too early for me anyway. So I've done all the things. I've taken away alcohol. I've taken away snacking after dinner. I've taken away screens. Like bedroom is for sleep only. It's a really calm place. There's no fighting. It's all wonderful. When I've been awake in the night, I've got up to pray. I've been like, I'm gonna take this. I'm gonna own this. And I'm gonna pray that this stops. I have stayed in bed to be like, maybe this is one of those nights where I just go back to sleep in five minutes. I've exercised, tried to include exercise in my routine more. Oh gosh, we need to do more of that generally. But I've got rid of the clock on my side of the bed so I don't know what time it is. I've done Lectio 365 app every night before I go to sleep to like zone me down and go to sleep. And I'm still here a few years later waiting for a stretch of really good sleep. For some of us, it is more significant. We're waiting for healing in our bodies. We're waiting for a first or a new job to open. We're doing all the right things. We really are. And we're praying about it. And nothing seems to be changing. And it would seem that sometimes it's just not enough. And so then what we have left is God's promise. And so we wait. And so we wait in expectation for the coming of Jesus again. We wait for God. We wait for Jesus. We wait for him to come to us. And so as we consider Advent, as we wait for Jesus to come, because all of the stuff isn't working and all of the prayers aren't being answered how we want, as we wait for Jesus to come in our longings and our desires, I just wanted to quickly take a little minute to look at the way in which God comes and the way that which God has chosen to come to us. This is not an exhaustive list, but it's just three things that I noticed that I thought I'd share with you today. The first is that he is a God who comes in unexpected ways. Firstly, the very fact that he is a God who comes to us is unexpected. He is not waiting from afar expecting humanity to make their way to him. He's not holding humanity aloof and in a state of servitude like many of the gods were considered at the time. But he is a God who comes to us. This is unexpected in itself. But then he comes as a humble human being, as a baby who became a carpenter, no less. Not as this charging warrior, not as a mighty, powerful, dictatorial leader that maybe the Israelites were anticipating. He's not like we usually go for a rags to riches kind of story, but he's actually the opposite. He's gone from riches to rags. That's the kind of king that he is. God comes in unexpected ways. And the second thing is that he is a God who comes at unexpected times. The Israelites knew he would come, but they had no idea when. We wait in anticipation of him coming again, but we have no idea when. It's very often when we least expect it. We've got the beauty of not being\n\nalone in the waiting, because we know that Jesus comes through Holy Spirit here and now. There's a vicar and author, David Adams, describes this unexpected timing of God. He says, while we're doing routine work, he comes. While we're mending our nets or our cars, he comes. While the very life we seek is slipping through our fingers, he comes. When we toil all night and catch nothing, he comes. When we're tired and frustrated, he comes. He comes when life seems to be escaping us. It is at such a moment that he comes, for he comes at unexpected times. And then thirdly, he is a God who comes and he brings new life. This couldn't be more plain than literally the birth of Jesus, a new life, the long-awaited Messiah. Quite literally, new life when God comes to humanity. Because this is who God is. It's an integral part of the nature of God that he creates life over and over and over again. If you'll indulge me, I'm just going to read a little bit from this little book of Advent. I've had this for the last couple of years. It's a little devotional for each day. I found it quite helpful. It's all right. I've got it. Thank you. And this is a little excerpt written by a former Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. And he speaks of this new life like this. The Christmas story could be told simply with a happy ending where the gospel reading ends. Shepherds are cold, shepherds see angels, shepherds head into town and see baby, and shepherds disappear into the sunrise happy. If we ended there, Christmas removes us from reality. Christmas becomes something utterly remote about lives entirely different, fictional, naive, and tidy. That's not Christmas. Jesus came to the reality of this world to transform that reality. Not to take us into some fantasy kind of happy ever after, but to bring good news of great joy for all people. Jesus breaks in, not to help us escape, but to transform, to take hold of our past, present, and future. Jesus did not come for one day. Jesus changed things forever. Jesus does not remove us from reality. He indwells it, and he indwells us if we invite him. God comes and he brings new life to this life. So those are my three points on how God comes. And so as we ponder Advent, as we acknowledge the ways in which we are left longing, desiring, waiting for something, I'd just like to suggest a couple of practical things and ways in which we can respond. And the first is by adopting a posture of surrender. And I don't mean this to sound trite, because that sounds like, oh yeah, just surrender it all, fine. But actually, some of us have been waiting a really long time for the thing that we would really like. Some of us will be waiting until Jesus comes again in fullness before we see it. We'll be waiting until God's kingdom rules in all its fullness everywhere. During Advent, we are invited to prepare our hearts and our lives to welcome Christ in. And I think part of preparation is surrendering our waiting hearts and saying, here it is, Jesus, I give it to you. In order to make way for Jesus to do what only he can do, to bring new life in unexpected ways and at unexpected times. For us to adopt a sense of not me, Jesus, but you, not my will, but yours, not my kingdom, but yours. And surrendering our world of waiting and fixes into an expectant, anticipated hope of what is sure to come. A world with no more tears or pain or waking nights. And we let that be our greatest desire and our greatest longing. And I think that as we surrender that, as we say, let me let this go, the second thing we can do is to keep a lookout. Just as my siblings and I did back in the day, waiting for someone to arrive, watching for what we thought was going to happen. We need to keep a lookout for where Jesus is coming in our lives now. For he doesn't just come at two points in history, once in the stable and then once again in the promised one day. But he comes through Holy Spirit here and now, over and over and over again. It may be that he doesn't have the red car we're expecting. It may be that he's coming from a different direction. He may be coming at a different time or in a different way to the one that we anticipated or would have marked out for ourselves. But he is coming and he is here. So let's keep our eyes, our ears, our hearts and our minds alert to see where God is coming. Where there is new life, where there are signs of the kingdom breaking through. Because they may very well be in unexpected places and at unexpected times. This quote says, to wait is to stretch oneself forward. Not in mere passivity, but we are attentive and opening ourselves to what will come. And so finally we pray. And I think that surrendering ourselves and our longings and our waitings to Jesus and watching for him moving and expecting unexpected things changes the way that we pray. We can go from please would you do this, please would you fix this, please would you answer my deep longing to I give you myself again. Jesus would you come in whatever way that you choose. And so we pray for Jesus to come once more here and now. As you did back then and you will do again Jesus, would you come. In the waiting we cry come Jesus in any way at any time in any place. Would you just come. Our desire is for you Jesus. For all that Jesus brings, restoration and hope and peace and reconciliation. We desire Jesus to walk this with us now and we desire his kingdom to come in full one day and soon. And so in the, I can't even see the clock because the light's on the wrong way. Daniel would you come up. The kids are going to come back in at some point in the next 5-10 minutes but we are going to take some time to pray now. If there is something that you are waiting and longing for and you need people to stand with you and cry come Lord Jesus however you want to come. This is going to be a wonderful moment to do that. Because I think as we enter the season of Advent where we engage with our story as God's people so far and we wait and we prepare for the coming of Jesus, we want to take some time to bring our longings and our waitings and our pains and our plans to him. And so we are going to make room for him today."

    "transcript": "is from Malachi chapter 3, reading from verses 1 to 12. If you want to follow in the church Bibles, that's page 995. Malachi 3. See, I am sending my messenger to prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple. The messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, indeed, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts. But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner's fire and like fuller's soap. He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the descendants of Levi and refine them like gold and silver until they present offerings to the Lord in righteousness. Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord, as in the days of old and as in former years. Then I will draw near to you for judgment. I will be swift to bear witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those who oppress the hired workers in their wages, the widow and the orphan, against those who thrust aside the alien and do not fear me, says the Lord of hosts. For I, the Lord, do not change. Therefore you, O children of Jacob, have not perished. Ever since the days of your ancestors, you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. Return to me and I will return to you, says the Lord of hosts. But you say, how shall we return? Will anyone rob God? Yet you are robbing me. But you say, how are we robbing you? In your tithes and offerings, you are cursed with a curse for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you. Bring the full tithe into the storehouse so that there may be food in my house and thus put me to the test, says the Lord of hosts. See if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you an overflowing blessing. I will rebuke the locust for you so that it will not destroy the produce of your soil and your vine in the field shall not be barren, says the Lord of hosts. Then all nations will count you happy for you will be a land of delight, says the Lord of hosts. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. The gospel reading is taken from Luke chapter 1, reading verses 26 to 38. They can be found on page 58 of the church Bible. The gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Luke. Glory to you, O Lord. The birth of Jesus is foretold. In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary and he came to her and said, Greetings, favoured one, the Lord is with you. But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of a greeting this might be. The angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. And now you will conceive in your womb and bear a son and you will name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the son of the most high and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there will be no end. Mary said to the angel, How can this be since I am a virgin? The angel said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be holy. He will be called son of God. And now your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son. And this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren. For nothing will be impossible with God. Then Mary said, Here am I, the servant of the Lord. Let it be with me according to your word. Then the angel departed from her. This is the gospel of the Lord. Praise to you, O Christ. Thank you both. May I speak with the spirit and may we hear with the understanding also. Well, I feel I should begin by wishing you all a happy new year because as Advent Sunday, as you know, is the first day of the new liturgical church year, isn't it? And the season of Advent marked through the four Sundays before Christmas is a time when we as Christians prepare for the coming of Jesus, both as we move towards Christmas and the celebration of Christ's birth and as we consider and reflect on his second coming, whenever that may be and in whatever circumstance. This year we're focusing, as I've said, on the hope, the peace, the joy and the love that the birth, life, death and new life of Jesus brings to us and to the world. And as we journey through Advent together as a church, we pray that we also grow together in that same hope, peace, joy and love. So, for hope, on first impressions, much of those scripture passages we've just heard don't necessarily shout hope to us, certainly not throughout, do they? The late prophetic book of Malachi was written at the time of the rededication of the temple around 500 years before Christ. Much of it is concerned with the way in which the worship at the temple had fallen into disorder, not least the role of the priests. A message for some of us there, I think. And the first four verses of that reading from Malachi, of course, apart from the association with that stirring contralto aria in Handel's Messiah, are, of course, most often heard in Advent, Advent carol services and so on. But its themes of purification and judgment don't feel particularly filled with hope, do they? Who can endure the age of his coming? Of course, Malachi is all about the coming messenger. Indeed, the word Malachi can be translated as my messenger, God's messenger. And the clear message is, before the Lord comes, the people need to be cleansed of their sins and the resulting right actions then will open the way for true blessings to flow. Then, in the closing verse of the passage, all nations will count you happy, for you will be a land of delight. A true message of hope there. These verses are often paired in the lectionary with the New Testament proclamation by John the Baptist, also God's messenger, and the baptism of repentance for forgiveness that he offered people. Sin was continuing to separate people from God 500 years down the line from that time when Malachi was written. So where's the hope? And I think we can often feel that today in the world, can't we? Well, this brings us to our gospel reading from Luke and the birth of Jesus being foretold. Through Emmanuel, God comes to be with us. Throughout the history of God's chosen, people have failed to heed the message of the prophets, so God comes himself. He comes to destroy the evil in us and in the world, to draw us into a new life, a life with Christ. But this isn't to happen in a particularly obvious and straightforward way, but it's going to happen through a young woman in an unimportant village in Galilee.\n\nIn the back of beyond, on this announcement we're told that Mary was perplexed. Well, who wouldn't be? She was told not to be afraid, but then she's told that she was to become pregnant and bear a son. This son would be great and called the son of the most high. He would be a king of a kingdom that would have no end. Well, I don't know whether perplexed really sums it up. It seems a huge understatement, that really, doesn't it? Unsurprisingly, Mary responds by questioning how all this could happen given that she's an unmarried virgin. However, the angel reassures her that all will be well, for nothing will be impossible with God. And for Mary, that was good enough. Let it be with me according to your word, she responds. Nothing will be impossible with God. And that's words of hope, not just for Mary, but for each one of us. So, can our hearts be filled with hope? Can we feel confident about what may happen tomorrow? What about when the future seems filled with anxiety and stress or uncertainty? When we look around at the state of the world, it doesn't feel particularly hopeful, does it? How can we walk in hope as Mary did when at times we may feel hopeless inside? Well, the hope we seek is found in Jesus, isn't it? Hope in Jesus comes from more than just a belief that he was once a baby in a manger. It's something deep within which secures us through the storms of life. As it says in the letter to the Hebrews, we have this hope, a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul. Perhaps we might find it helpful to think of this word hope as a sort of acrostic, taking the four letters. So H, we could think of as help. Jesus invites us to come to him and confidently ask for help in times of need. O, overcome. When circumstances leave us feeling powerless and hopeless, through Christ's strength, we are enabled to overcome the obstacles life puts in our way. Faith in Jesus can give us hope and help us to overcome those obstacles or at least to learn to live with them. It's a bit like when a loved one has died and the person will say to me, maybe a year or so later, I don't seem to be able to get over this. And I said, well, don't try to get over it. You can't get over something like that, can you? We pray that you can learn to live with that loss. And I think that's what I mean here. We're not going to actually get rid of all the obstacles and difficulties of life, are we? But through God's help, we can learn to live with them. And very often out of adversity comes great hope. P in the P in hope, power. When things seem just too difficult or complicated for us to deal with, through Jesus we have the hope that God can give us the strength we need to tackle what we may feel is impossible. Get my last bit of paper. And the E in hope is eternity. When we put our faith and trust in Jesus, we not only find help and a way to overcome and the power to face the seemingly impossible, we also have hope for life beyond this one, don't we? In eternal life. Surely the greatest hope of all. So, apart from this advent taking a daily stroll along Custoat Road to see Caroline and Julian Rivers' conservatory window advent calendar gradually emerging, as we begin a new year in the church, so may we make time to perhaps make a resolution to take a moment each day to reflect on those times when we have turned to Jesus in hope and consider how we may do so in every situation and so experience and share the hope Jesus offers, not just in advent but throughout the year. For our hope is in the Lord. And that's all there is to it. Amen."

    "transcript": "taken from Luke, chapter 1, verses 26 to 38, and this can be found on page 58 of the New Testament part of the church Bibles. In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David.

Then Mary said, Here am I, the servant of the Lord. Let it be with me according to your word. Then the angel departed from her. This is the word of the Lord. Thank you so much, Lucy. Hopefully I'm on. Good morning. It's so good to be with you as we explore God's word together. My name is Jack. I'm an ordinand at Trinity College. That means I'm training to be a vicar and learning from you lovely people. And Meg, my wife, and I have really enjoyed joining you all at St Mary's. We've moved from Winchester, where I've been for the last 10 years. I trained as a primary school teacher and then have been working for a church there. Meg's a nurse. And that jump and that move was really big, and you guys have made it really easy. So thank you for welcoming us so well. You've been a real gift. I wonder how you feel about us getting to the first Sunday of Advent. I'll be honest, it's crept up on me a little bit. And I'm never against celebrating early. Meg and I did put our Christmas tree up yesterday, and we went and saw Muppet Christmas Carol with a live orchestra. So not against celebrating early, but it has crept up on me. And in our Advent sermon series, each week we'll be considering something that Jesus brought to earth with him. This week, hope, then peace, joy, and love. And as we gather around this passage to think about hope, something we thought about a little bit last week as we wrapped up our time in Ruth, I feel deeply a sympathy with the words of the song, O Holy Night, one of my favourite Christmas carols, in which we sing, A thrill of hope, a weary world rejoices. Now I think our world often feels weary and hurting and transient. But in global turmoil and personal disappointment, God wants to bring us that hope that leads to great joy. And that hope comes in unlikely places. Let's pray together. Father God, thank you for your word. Thank you for this season. I pray that you'd bless us as you speak to us through it. Amen. So as Simon has said, Advent is a time where we enter into waiting for Jesus. It's a time of expectation and anticipation. It doesn't start on the 1st of December as you open that tiny cardboard door that rips frustratingly off in your hand and eat the chocolate. As I might say, all beauty products. Don't eat the beauty product. Eat the chocolate behind it or look at the little picture. It doesn't begin at this story, which is often the beginning of our nativity play. Mary met by an angel. The waiting that we enter into at Advent is a waiting that was happening long before these events. As God's people, who themselves were living in a weary world, a time of political upheaval, they were waiting restlessly for a Messiah, for a rescuer. As I was thinking about hope, I read that hope has to have an object to be hope. So I might hope that the weather will be nice. That was the object of much of mine and Meg's hopes and prayers in the run-up to our wedding, which didn't have a very good wet weather plan. The object of our hope was really good weather. You might be hoping for a lovely jumper or something else for Christmas. That's the object of your hope. For the people of God before Jesus, the object of their hope, their hope is pinned on the arrival of a coming king, God's son. They want a political hero to charge in, sort out the powers that are in their way, and lead them well, a new Moses, a new David. And they'd have specific ideas about where that new king should come from. Despite knowing where Moses and David came from, they thought this political leader should come from a specific place. And Luke knows this as he composes his gospel. The passage before today, if you flick to page 57 in your Bibles, is one where we meet a priest called Zechariah. Now that might have felt like a more likely place for the Messiah to come in, a righteous male priest working in the temple, the place where God dwells, visited by an angel. But God brings hope to an unlikely place. Zechariah's child will be John the Baptist, who will point to Jesus. And as we think about that pointing, the camera that Luke is operating, his words pan from the temple, the place we'd expect the Messiah to come from, to a young girl in a village who will be the mother of the Messiah. Now this is the most unlikely place, highlighted by the first thing mentioned about Mary. If you look at everything mentioned about Zechariah in chapter 1, verse 5, it's a priest named Zechariah. It tells you his job, his descendants, where he's come from. But if you turn the page and look at what we hear about Mary, the first thing said to her, or said about her rather, in verse 27, a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary. Before we even get her name, we get that she's a virgin and we get her husband's name. Time and time again in the Old Testament, when God is doing a new thing, a woman who struggles to conceive gets pregnant, miraculously. We've seen this time and time again in Explorer 4 this term, as we've looked at women in the Bible, Sarah, Hannah. And Luke is almost pointing here like it's happening again. God is doing a new thing. But it's bigger and it's better. This is the ultimate, because Mary isn't just too old to have a baby or trying to have a baby but it's just not happening. Luke makes it really clear. This is the ultimate new thing that God is doing, the ushering in of the kingdom of God, the birth of the Messiah, because Mary, a virgin, is about to be told that she is pregnant. The hope of God comes through her. God brings hope into unlikely places. Now we may think of this as an exciting moment for Mary and I think it's because of the nativity plays that we watch every year. It's a sweet prologue, isn't it? But the reality was so different. We think of Mary as a bored older teenager kind of sweeping the floor like Cinderella, wishing wistfully that her life will begin and it will all be great and oh, woe is me, I'm sad and sweeping and maybe one day something will happen. And then an angel comes and everything's great and God is here. The hope has come and she's a part of it. There's a little song. Everybody claps. End of the scene. That's the nativity play version of this story. That's the sanitized version that when we read this, that's all we can see is an eight-year-old with a blue tea towel on her head. But the reality is so different. Mary was a young teenage girl, 13 or 14, looking forward to the rest of her life. She's engaged to be married. Part of the marriage ceremony is underway. She's living with her parents in keen anticipation to be with the one she loves. And in many ways, her...\n\nAdvent, her waiting, her expectation is for her life to begin, not for God to intervene, but just normally as she gets married to Joseph. Everything's good and going the way it should be and then an angel appears with big news. God brings hope to an unlikely place, but it soon transpires that Mary isn't an unlikely person. She may not be the person we expect. She's definitely not the person that the world expected, but she's not unlikely in the sight of God. The first words that the angel speaks, if you look down in verse 28, is that she is favoured and that the Lord is with her. Now this isn't really even the scary bit, but it's the bit that other translations says deeply troubles Mary. In our translation it just says that she was much perplexed and pondered, which I love as a phrase. But if you go back to Zechariah, when the angel visits him, a priest in the temple whom we might expect would be used to an angelic visitation, he is terrified. Terrified and the fear overwhelms him, that's what the NRSV says. But Mary, the unlikely virgin teenager, is simply troubled or perplexed. Why is God talking to me? I'm not special. It's the beginning of every kind of teenage movie, isn't it? I'm not special. Why me? And I think we'd respond similarly if God spoke to us and said to us even those simple words, you're favoured. God is with you. I think we live in a culture which is hyper individualistic but quite quick to be self-deprecating, to think too lowly of ourselves. And that means we grab affirmation where we can, in the love of friends and family, achievements at school or college or promotions at work. But how would we feel hearing these words, knowing what God thinks of us? Because the truth is that we do know that, but we just choose not to dwell on it. Paul in Colossians 3.12 suggests that we are God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved. Hear those words. We are God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved. I'm sure that perplexes many of us. It might even trouble you. This hope from God comes into unlikely places, but we are not too unlikely for God to be able to use us. And if you're sat here today feeling like you're not worth enough for God to use you, think of the jars of water meant for washing hands at a wedding that Jesus turns into the best wine. Think of the picnic of a little boy that Jesus uses to feed 5,000 people. Think of Mary physically unable to have children just yet. But as we discover later in our passage, with God, nothing is impossible. We are not too unlikely for God to use us. He's bigger than that. So Mary has had a greeting, but then the big bombshell arrives. The angel tells her that she is pregnant. It's the end of all the best EastEnders episodes. And that's because it's usually dramatic and scary, though in our Nativity play, it's happy and good. This wouldn't have felt like hope. What is hope for the whole world would have felt like the end of her life, her marriage over, her reputation ruined, scandal in the family. And we know she has every reason to panic because if an angel hadn't visited Joseph, he would have divorced her quietly. But there's a greater hope in what the angel is saying that Mary would have known as somebody in that society waiting for the Messiah. If you look down at verses 31 to 33, and now you, Mary, will conceive in your womb and bear a son and you will name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there will be no end. To someone in that society, that would have been tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. There is no doubt who this is. This is the Messiah, the one who has come to bring hope to a people who have been waiting for many years for this rescuer. And Mary is simply curious. How can this be, she asks. I think most of us realistically would respond by laughing or crying or running or if it was me, probably a combination of all three, just not very quickly. But Mary stops. She thinks. She asks God for clarity. Mary is immediately willing to contemplate the cost of carrying Christ. Immediately willing to contemplate the cost of carrying Christ. And in many ways she's asking, where is God in this? How is God going to do this? And Gabriel tells her that the Spirit will surround her and overshadow her. It's almost like glory itself will descend. That word overshadow makes me think of the manifest presence of God that went with the people of Israel in the wilderness, that descended on the temple. That same word is used in the Gospels when God speaks at Jesus' baptism and transfiguration. You are my son whom I love. The question, how, is answered rather unsurprisingly, God. It's everybody's classic Sunday school answer. And as proof it will happen, almost like a receipt, Elizabeth, Mary's cousin, even in her old age, is already pregnant. Nothing is impossible for God. And Mary says yes. Here am I, verse 38, the servant of the Lord. Let it be with me according to your word. And in that moment, Mary would have seen all of the terrifying things ahead. Not only the relationships and reputation lost, but the responsibility gained. Imagine the five years, five minutes even, I'm sure the first five years were hard too. But imagine those first five minutes after the announcement. Mary hasn't told anybody about what lays ahead. Who does she tell first? What does she say? Imagine the thoughts racing around her head. Now in the nativity play, if we return to our eight-year-old with her blue tea towel on her head, this next bit goes a bit too quickly because it's Mary and Joseph are going to have a baby. Oh, there's a census over there. Off they go on their little donkey and start knocking on doors. But it doesn't happen that quickly. It doesn't happen that quickly. She doesn't just have to say yes to Jesus. She has to bear the daily cost of carrying Him. This isn't the nativity play. This is reality. And she not only carries Him, she travels a long way to confirm Gabriel's announcement about Elizabeth and then a long way to Bethlehem. How willing are we to carry Jesus in our lives? To bear the cost of carrying Him every day? Do you think Mary felt highly favoured as she bore the shame inflicted on her by those in her village whose opinions of her changed rapidly as they heard the news? Highly favoured as she had morning sickness and felt ill? As she gave birth? As she saw her son now fully grown being shoved and pushed out of Nazareth? As she saw Him die on the cross? Highly favoured? Being favoured by God does not mean that life is easy. And Mary in many ways, in saying yes to Jesus, becomes the first Christian, the first disciple. And so she's the first to experience that the path of discipleship is narrow. It's hard. Simeon tells her that a sword will pierce her own heart. And yet this is the hope of the whole world coming in an unlikely place. There are two choices in our passage. Mary is chosen by God and Mary chooses to say yes to God. And we too, here at St Mary's, have a choice like Mary does. We too have had a messenger come down from heaven to say that we are chosen and loved and His name is Jesus. The baby carried by Mary is the one who saves us and asks us to make a choice. God chooses you. Will you choose Him? For some of us here today, the idea that God chooses you will be hard. But let me repeat what I shared earlier. We are not too unlikely for God to use us. We have a treasure in jars of clay. We may be weak but God is strong. What a hope. For some of us, choosing to say yes to God will seem impossible. But our passage shows us that nothing is impossible with God. Biblical hope isn't waiting or hoping for better circumstances. It's waiting for God Himself to show up.\n\nin the middle of all that stuff. As we began our time together, I mentioned that beautiful line, a thrill of hope, a weary world rejoices. And so if you're feeling weary at the beginning of Advent, if you are in a hopeless season right now, or feel like the world is just too broken for God to still be good, the theologian Fleming Rutledge writes that in Advent we don't simply pretend to enter the darkness that the world was in before the birth of Christ. She suggests that we take a good, hard look at the darkness now, facing and defining it honestly, so that we will understand with utmost clarity that our great and only hope is in Jesus' final victorious coming. We don't pretend, we take a good, hard look at the darkness now and see that the light that the darkness can't understand or overcome is on its way. As we journey into winter and towards Christmas, as days get darker and schedules get busier, I invite you to remember this word of hope that may feel like it comes in the most unlikely of places. God chooses you. Will you choose to say yes to him every day? Let me end with these words from Romans 15 as a prayer. May the God of hope fill us with all joy and peace as we trust in him, so that we may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Thank you."

    "transcript": "the church Bibles in the Old Testament section. Let's pray. Jesus, thank you for your word. Thank you for the people whose lives we're reflecting on today. Thank you for their witness, their part in your salvation history. And I thank you that we are swept up into their story. Would you give us ears to hear and hearts that are ready to respond to your call afresh today? Amen. Well, it's mid-November and in the vicarage, that means that we have to start thinking about Christmas, partly because of my job and partly because at least one of my two children thinks that Christmas season begins on the 1st of November, much to my distress. But I wonder whether any of you are already thinking about when to watch your favourite Christmas film. Maybe you are, maybe you're not. It's a cliche, but my must-watch every year Christmas film is Love Actually. It's in my top three favourite films of all time. And I never cease to be moved by the stories of the eight different families that are featured in that film. And what I really appreciate about it is the way that it shows us what love looks like in a variety of different situations. There's the love of a sister for a brother with very significant additional needs. There's the love of a wife which can overcome her husband's transgression. There's the love of a father for his bereaved stepson and so on. And it highlights love which, in many instances, not all, is so extraordinary that it takes our breath away. And whether or not we see it on a screen or read it in a novel or experience it in our own lives, deep love has a way of truly surprising us. And two weeks ago, we had a pause for Remembrance Sunday, but if you've been with us on this journey through the book of Ruth, we left their story of Ruth and Naomi and Boaz on a cliffhanger at the end of chapter 3. And it looked hopeful that change was afoot for Naomi and Ruth. And Boaz has said these amazing words to Ruth. He said, May you be blessed, my daughter. I will do for you all that you ask. Chapter 3, verses 10 and 11. But there was a snag, because Boaz knew of another man in Bethlehem who needed to be consulted about this decision to be the redeemer before any firm decisions could be made. And two weeks ago, when I was preaching on Ruth 3, I was describing the book of Ruth as a love story, and I really stand by that. But the more we look at it and the more we're going to get into in chapter 4, we see that it is not primarily a romantic love story. What it is, is a beautiful demonstration of familial love. Love within families. And it's showing us what love and responsibility look like when you put them together. It's showing us how dutiful, respectful love for those who need it and deserve it can make a difference, not just to our own immediate family, but to all the generations that will follow on after us. And in Ruth 3, we noticed that despite being on their own in a secluded place in the middle of the night, Boaz and Ruth act completely honorably towards each other. And from what we see in chapter 4, it seems like they do that primarily because of their shared love for and their responsibility towards Naomi, as opposed to any attraction towards one another that they might feel. And so chapter 4 tells us what happened the morning after. At the town gate of Bethlehem where legal decisions were made, it would be the same as now us going to a courthouse or maybe to a solicitor's office. And there's lots of contrasts between chapter 3 and chapter 4, but particularly in terms of posture. So chapter 3, lots of emphasis on lying down, Boaz and Ruth lying down next to one another. And now in chapter 4, Boaz is very clearly sitting down. And he invites his friend to sit down with him. And then the 10 elders of the town also sit down and witness this legal transaction. And so the situation is explained. There's another man in Bethlehem who is more closely related to Naomi than Boaz is. And this man, the next of kin, who interestingly, for men in the Bible, is remaining unnamed, has the right to say that he wants to acquire the land that belonged to Naomi's late husband, Elimelech. And in doing so, he would also acquire Ruth and Naomi as dependents. And I think it's a bit surprising that this man turns down that offer. We don't know why, other than he says it will damage his own inheritance. So be that as it may, that leaves Boaz as the next closest relative of Naomi's, duty-bound to step up and shoulder responsibility for these two women. And so to seal the deal, the unnamed man hands Boaz his sandal, and Boaz gives a speech that concludes with these words. He says, I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Malon, to be my wife, to maintain the dead man's name on his inheritance, in order that the name of the dead may not be cut off from his kindred and from the gate of his native place. Today you are my witnesses. And that bit of Boaz's speech gives us a clue to the extraordinary love that is being demonstrated here by Boaz. He has love and respect for a man he once knew, Elimelech, but who he hadn't seen for a long time and who now had died. And he has love and respect for Elimelech's sons, Malon and Chilion, who probably, and I am surmising here, he would have known when they were young boys before Naomi and Elimelech took their family to Moab. But he hadn't seen them for a long time and now both of them have also died. And so this love and respect for his kin is translated into love and respect for the two women who remain from this family, Naomi and Ruth. And Ruth, because of her age, was the only hope left if the family line of Elimelech were going to continue. What Boaz primarily seems to want is for Naomi to be honoured and protected through the provision of a grandson for her who will take the family name onwards into the future. So Naomi, Boaz's kin, has got a need and Boaz knows that he can help provide it. Providing of needs. I know from conversations with a great many of you over the years that I've been here that so many of you are now or have been in the past carers in some shape or form for relatives in need. And I know what a toll that can take on people and if that is you right now and you're feeling weary then let me say to you, well done and keep going. Because that kind of love and devotion is often undervalued and under-celebrated in our country. And I think we should be cheering each other on as we faithfully tend to the physical and emotional and practical needs of people within our families who need that extra care because of age or illness or circumstance. So if that's you, you are extraordinary. And the love that you have shown or you are showing is extraordinary. And by loving in that way, you are in part reflecting the extraordinary love of God into this world. And I believe your faithfulness will have implications for good far\n\nbeyond what you can currently see or imagine. You don't need me to tell you that romantic love is not a universal experience. Some people by choice or by circumstance will never love someone else in that way. But everyone is born into a family. It might be a very tiny family, just the baby and the mother who has given birth to him or her. And sadly for some children, it's not appropriate for them to grow up with members of their birth family. But the intention, at least in our country, is that every child is cared for and nurtured within the context of a family of some size or description, whether they are biologically related or not. Families really matter, don't they? Families matter to God. And the Bible is essentially one long story about God's family. And we're reminded of some of the people who came earlier in that story of God's family through the words of the people of Bethlehem in the last bit of the chapter four that we read. And quite astonishingly, after this legal contract has been made and the sandal's been passed over, there seems to be, the way I read it, I think it's a spontaneous prayer of blessing being prayed over Boaz and Ruth by the people of Bethlehem. And they say this, then all the people who were at the gate along with the elders said, we are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah who together built up the house of Israel. May you produce children in Ephrathah and bestow a name in Bethlehem and through the children that the Lord will give you by this young woman, may your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah. They're praying that God would make Ruth to be like Rachel and Leah. Let me briefly jump us back to Genesis. Rachel and Leah were sisters who became the wives of Jacob and they, along with two other women, produced his 12 sons who went on to become founders of the massively significant 12 tribes of Israel. You can delve back into their story in Genesis 28 through to 2035 to get the backstory of Rachel and Leah and their tumultuous relationship with one another and with Jacob to whom they were both married. But we can recall that Rachel was initially barren, but in the end, God blessed her with two sons, Joseph and Benjamin. And we can also pay attention to the reference here to Ephrathah. That's both a region and a descriptive term in Hebrew. It's the region, the area around Bethlehem, which was the center of agriculture at the time. And the name Ephrathah literally means fruitful or abundant. So it was a fertile land, a place of growth. And when people heard that word, it would have been linked in their minds to the blessing of God and God providing for his people. And also, fascinatingly, if you read Genesis 35, it is the place where Rachel died as she was giving birth to Benjamin. Whether they realize it or not, the people of Bethlehem on this day of this transaction are prophetically declaring that the child that God will bless to Boaz and Ruth will be an important one in the narrative of God's covenant people. And next week, when we bring the journey with Ruth into land, I'll explain more about that. And Simon's alluded to it with the genealogy in Matthew's gospel. But that does indeed turn out to be the case because their son, Obed, becomes the grandfather of King David, who is a vitally important figure in Old Testament history. And then many generations later, in the same line comes Jesus, the one who will offer to redeem not just members of his own family, but the whole world. And before we assume that this family was somehow more special or more holy than other families or our family, then we need to think again because the lives of Rachel and Leah and Jacob were complicated and certainly not without dysfunction. But the prayer of blessing over Ruth and Boaz also mentions some of Jacob's descendants, Judah, Tamar, and Perez. And you can find their story in Genesis 38. I'm gonna tell you it very briefly. Judah is the fourth of Leah's sons, so one of the 12 sons of Jacob. And Tamar later becomes his daughter-in-law. There is a complicated turn of events. Tamar's husband dies and the brother of her husband dies. Does that sound familiar? And in desperation to continue the family line, Tamar becomes pregnant by Judah, her father-in-law, by pretending to be a prostitute. And Tamar and Judah end up having twin sons called Perez and Zerah. That's quite messy, isn't it? And yet the people of Bethlehem remember that complex part of the history of God's people and then they link it to the union of Boaz and Ruth. Clearly, there are some key differences. Boaz and Ruth, as we've said, have acted honorably. The family line is continued by dutiful devotion, not by deceptive manipulation. But nonetheless, it's another case, I think, of God making a way where it seemed like there was no way. In Matthew chapter one, we get that genealogy of Jesus and it dates all the way from him back to Abraham. And usually in genealogies in ancient Israel, there wouldn't be any women mentioned in them. But astonishingly, there are five women mentioned in that genealogy. Tamar, who we've just met, Rahab, also a prostitute, Ruth, Bathsheba, adulteress with David, and Mary. Also mentioned are Judah, Perez, Boaz, Obed, and many others. And all of those people's stories combine into one long family history that stretches back to the beginning and takes us all the way to Jesus and beyond. And so we, in our own messy, dysfunctional families, and let's face it, they all are, aren't they? Are caught up into this bigger story and invited to demonstrate that same extraordinary love that we see time and time and time again through the pages of the Bible. And so whatever it is that you're facing today in your own family and with those who you see as family, I pray that God will give you the strength to keep on loving, keep on serving, because he uses all of these selfless acts of compassion and kindness for good. And there will be repercussions from them in ways that we will never see or realize in our lifetime. So keep going, good and faithful servants, and hear those words of well done from Jesus today. Tideo's gonna come and lead us now in prayer. Thank you."

    "transcript": "passing by. So Boaz said, come over friend, sit down here. And he went over and sat down. Then Boaz took ten men of the elders of the city and said, sit down here. So they sat down. He then said to the next of kin, Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land that belonged to our kinsman, Elimelech. So I thought I would tell you of it and say, buy it in the presence of those sitting here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it. But if you will not, tell me so I may know. For there is no one prior to you to redeem it and I come after you. So he said, I will redeem it. Then Boaz said, the day you acquire the field from the hand of Naomi, you are also acquiring Ruth, the Moabite, the widow of the dead man, to maintain the dead man's name on his inheritance. At this, the next of kin said, I cannot redeem it for myself without damaging my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I cannot redeem it. Now this was a custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging. To confirm a transaction, one party took off a sandal and gave it to the other. This was a manner of attesting in Israel. So when the next of kin said, no, Boaz, acquire it for yourself, he took off his sandal. Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, today you are witnesses that I have acquired from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilean and Marlon. I have also acquired Ruth, the Moabite, the wife of the belonging to Chilean and Marlon. I have also acquired Ruth, the Moabite, the wife of Marlon to be my wife, to maintain the dead man's name on his inheritance in order that the name of the dead man may not be cut off from his kindred and from the gate of his native place. Today you are witnesses. Then all the people here at the gate, along with the elders, said, we are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you produce children in Ephrathah and bestow a name in Bethlehem. And through the children that the Lord will give you by this young woman, may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Thank you, Mark. Steve, am I on at your end? Nearly. Excellent. Brilliant. This is great. Do have the Bible open, page 269 to 270, Old Testament section of the church Bibles in the chairs in front of you or near you. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we thank you so much for your word. Thank you that it is alive and active in our hearts. And I pray now that you would help us to hear from you and to apply it to our lives. Amen. Well, it's mid-November. I don't need me to tell you that. In the vicarage, Christmas begins, according to my daughter, on the 1st of November, which I'm always quite resistant about until about this time when I'm like, I really ought to start thinking about Christmas, at least from a church point of view, if not from a home point of view. But I know some people kind of get ready more quickly and certainly the adverts try and get us to be ready very early. So has anybody already watched their kind of, I must watch this every year, Christmas movie? No? Okay. Who has a, I must watch this every year, Christmas movie? And there's, yeah, lots of you. Okay, brilliant. Fine. My must watch every year Christmas movie is very cliched. It's love, actually. I never cease to be moved by the stories of the eight kind of families, collections of people featured in it. And what I particularly love about that film is that it shows us what love looks like in a variety of different situations. There's the love of a sister for a brother with very complex additional needs. There's the love of a wife who can overcome her husband's transgression. There's the love of a father for his young, bereaved stepson and so on. Not all of the people featured perhaps as laudable as some of those ones, but in lots of different ways it highlights love that is extraordinary. So much so that it takes our breath away. And whether we see it on a screen or read it in a novel or experience it in our own lives, deep love, I think, always surprises us. And as Julie said, we've been journeying over the last few weeks with Ruth and Naomi and Boaz as we've explored that short book in the Old Testament. And I know that not all of you have kind of been here for each of the weeks when we've been looking at it. But last week we left, no, two weeks ago, last week was Remembrance Sunday, two weeks ago we left the story on a bit of a cliffhanger at the end of chapter three. And it looked really hopeful that there was going to be change afoot for Naomi and Ruth. And Boaz has said these lovely, beautiful words to Ruth. He says, may you be blessed, my daughter. I will do for you all that you ask. That's chapter three, verses 10 to 11. And Ruth has asked Boaz to be the redeemer of their family. I'll remind us what that means in just a moment. But there's a snag. The snag is that Boaz knows of somebody else, another man in Bethlehem, who had more of a right and a responsibility to be the redeemer of Naomi's family than he did. And so that man needed to be consulted before any firm decisions were made. Two weeks ago, I described the book of Ruth as a love story, and I do stand by that. But the more we look at it, and particularly we see this in chapter four, it's not primarily a romantic love story. What it is, is a beautiful demonstration of familial love, love within families, close and more widely. And it shows us what love and responsibility look like when you put them together. It shows us how dutiful, respectful love for those in need and who deserve it can make a difference, not just to our immediate family in the here and now, but to generations who will follow. And last time in chapter three, I drew out the fact that despite the fact that they were on their own in a secluded place in the middle of the night, Boaz and Ruth act completely honorably towards each other. And what we get in chapter four is their motives for doing that. It seems that they're doing it primarily because of their shared love and their responsibility towards Naomi. So Naomi is as important in the book of Ruth as Ruth is, possibly more important. And it's not really, we don't get from the narrative about any possible attraction towards one another. They act in the way that they do because they both love Naomi. And chapter four tells us what happened the morning after at the town gate of Bethlehem where the legal decisions were made. And it would be the same as if we were going to a register office or perhaps a solicitor's office. And there's a contrast between chapter three and chapter four in terms of posture. So the emphasis in chapter three is Boaz and Ruth are lying down together. We get that, the writer of this book emphasizes that several times that they were lying down with all of its additional connotations of that posture. And here at the beginning of chapter four, Boaz is very clearly sitting down.\n\ninvites his friend, this other man, to sit down with him. And then the 10 elders of the town are also sat down with him as well, witnessing this legal conversation and transaction. And so the situation is explained. There's another man in Bethlehem who is more closely related to Naomi than Boaz is. And so that man is the next of kin. I think it's fascinating that this man is unnamed. Usually men in scripture that get as many kind of words about them as this man does are named, but this man is not named. But he has the right to say that he wants to acquire the land around Bethlehem, you know, whatever it was, a few fields that belonged to Naomi's late husband, Elimelech. But the important thing that Boaz points out to him is that in doing so, in acquiring that land, he also has to acquire Ruth and Naomi as dependents. Indeed, the honorable thing to do would be to acquire Ruth as his wife in order to hopefully enable her to bear children to continue that family line. I spoke a couple of weeks ago about women and kind of how the Bible sort of culture presents them as sort of almost as property to be sort of passed around and bartered with. And I'm not going to kind of go into that again. But just being clear that this is a particular sort of way of doing things. There's some cultural stuff that doesn't translate across that well for us, perhaps. But the important thing to remember is that actually in all of this, it's about honoring Naomi and Ruth and making sure that they are provided for and protected. And it looks like this unnamed next of kin is going to say, yes, I'll have the land. That would be brilliant. And then when he realizes it comes with kind of Ruth and Naomi, he says, oh, no, I can't. It will damage my own inheritance. I'm not quite sure to what extent how that would have been the case, but we can just let that one lie. And so as the next nearest next of kin, Boaz can step up. He's the next closest relative of Naomi's. And so he's duty bound indeed to step up and to shoulder the responsibility for these two women. And so to seal the deal, the unnamed man gives Boaz his sandals. And then Boaz gives a speech which concludes with these words. He says, I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Marlon, to be my wife, to maintain the dead man's name on his inheritance in order that the name of the dead may not be cut off from his kindred and from the gate of his native place today, you are witnesses. And so actually that is the clue about the extraordinary love that's being demonstrated here by Boaz. He actually is honoring and showing his love for Elimelech, a man who he hadn't seen for a long time and who'd now died, but presumably who he grew up with in Bethlehem in this relatively small community before Naomi and Elimelech went to Moab to escape the famine. And he's showing as well love and respect for Elimelech's sons, Marlon and Chilion, even though they would have probably been very small children when the family went to Moab. And now they've both died. And yet Boaz is showing the love and respect for his kin, for these kinsmen, and translating it into love and respect for the two women who remain, Naomi and Ruth. And Ruth is described as a young woman. She is the seed of hope if the family line of Elimelech is going to continue. Boaz wants Naomi to be honored by the provision of a grandson for her who will take her family name onwards into the future and offer her protection for the rest of her life. Naomi has a need and Boaz through Ruth can help to provide it. And one of the great privileges of being a vicar is that I get to talk to lots of you and many of you are sort of really honest and open in sharing things with me that are kind of going on for you in your lives. And I know that many of you now and in the past and will in the future care above and beyond for relatives in need. And I know what a toll that takes on you. And if that is you right now and you're in the midst of some really complicated stuff or you're just feeling really weary, let me say to you, well done and keep going because that kind of love and devotion for family members, for close friends, for maybe fairly distant relatives but who don't have anyone else to look after them is often undervalued and definitely under celebrated in our society. And I think we should be totally cheering each other on as we faithfully tend to the physical, the emotional, the practical needs of people in our sphere of influence who need extra care, maybe because of age or health or circumstance. And what I don't want anybody to hear is a sense of guilt if there are things that you can't do. Because clearly having good boundaries and understanding what we can offer and what is appropriate for us to offer and what medical professionals need to do or people in residential homes who can give sort of 24 hour care for some people who need it. It is okay. In fact, it's right and good to make use of other aspects of care. But we still as people close to those who need that extra support can still give so much. And that giving is extraordinary. And the love that is being shown by you and many others is extraordinary. And you're reflecting something of the love of God into this world as you do that. And I believe that your faithfulness will have implications for good far beyond what you can see or imagine. You don't need me to tell you that romantic love is not a universal experience. Some people by choice or by circumstance will never love someone else in that way. But everyone is born into a family. Might be a tiny family, just possibly that baby and the woman who birthed them. And sadly for some children, it's not appropriate for them to grow up with members of their birth family. But the intention within our society, at least, is that every child is cared for and nurtured within the context of a family of some shape or size, whether they are biologically related or not. Families matter. Families matter to God. And the Bible is essentially one long story about God's family. And the words of the people of Bethlehem in Ruth chapter 4 remind us of that. And what seems to happen is that after this legal contract has been made and the sandal has been passed over, I think from the text, it reads like there's this spontaneous prayer of blessing prayed over Boaz and Ruth by the people who've witnessed it. It says, then all the people who were at the gate, along with the elders, said, we are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. And may you produce children in Ephrathah and bestow a name in Bethlehem. And through the children that the Lord will give you by this young woman, may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah. What they're praying is that God would make Ruth to be like Rachel and Leah. You can read about Rachel and Leah and their husband. They both had the same husband. He was called Jacob. He was the son of Abraham. And no, he wasn't. He was the son of Isaac. And you can read their story in Genesis 28 through to 35 and get their backstory. But essentially, they\n\nproduced along with two other women, their servants, the twelve sons of Jacob. And those twelve sons went on to become the founding men of the twelve tribes of Israel, massively significant in the Old Testament. But Rachel and Leah had a really complicated relationship with each other and both of them had a complicated relationship with Jacob, to whom they were married. And Rachel initially was barren and waited many years to have children, but in the end God blessed her with two sons, Joseph of the coloured coat, and Benjamin, the youngest of the twelve sons of Jacob. So hold that in your mind. I also want to draw attention to a word that might have sounded unfamiliar to you in that prayer of blessing from Ruth 4. It's Ephathra. Ephathra is both a region and also a descriptive term in Hebrew. So it's a region, it's the area around Bethlehem, a centre of agriculture. It was a fertile land. And so that word Ephathra literally means fruitful or abundant. And when people heard that word, they would have thought of the geographical area, but they also would have thought about God's blessing and provision for his people, the way that God provides growth and fruitfulness. And I find this fascinating, but were you to flip back to Genesis 35, you would note that the place where Rachel died, giving birth to Benjamin, is Ephathra. It's named as that place. So whether or not they realise it, the people of Bethlehem are prophetically declaring that the child that God will bless to Boaz and Ruth will be an important one in God's covenant people and their narrative. And next week I'll be saying a little bit more about this as we think about generosity as a theme across the whole of the book of Ruth. But their son Obed ends up being the grandfather of King David, a vitally important figure in Old Testament history. And then in that same family tree, that same line, many generations later comes Jesus, the one who will offer not just to redeem members of his family, but the whole world. But before we think that that family, the family that kind of began with Rachel and Leah and Jacob was more special or more holy than others, we need to think again because their lives were really complicated and there was a lot of dysfunction within their family tree. And the prayer of blessing over Ruth and Boaz also mentions a few other people within Jacob's family, mentions Judah, Tamar and Perez. And were you to want to read their story, you could find it in Genesis 38. Judah is the fourth son of Leah, so he's the fourth of the twelve sons of Jacob, the twelve tribes of Israel. And later Tamar becomes his daughter-in-law, she marries one of Judah's sons, he has two sons. And there's a complicated turn of events. Tamar's husband dies and then Judah's other son dies. Is this starting to sound familiar? And in desperation to keep the family line going, Tamar becomes pregnant by Judah. She does that by dressing up and pretending to be a prostitute, so he doesn't know who she is. And they end up having twin sons called Perez and Sarah. I mean, talk about messy. I mean, we all have messy families, don't we? But I just love that there's kind of, there's so much dysfunction within the narrative of God's people. And yet the people of Bethlehem are remembering this complex part of the history of God's family and they're linking it to the union of Boaz and Ruth. Clearly there are some differences. We know Boaz and Ruth acted honorably at the threshing floor and their family line is going to be continued by dutiful devotion, not by deceptive manipulation. But nonetheless, it seems like it's another example of God making a way where it seemed like there was no way. And next week we're going to think a bit more about Matthew chapter 1 and the genealogy of Jesus, which is told dating back from Abraham all the way through to Jesus. And there are five women who are mentioned in that genealogy in Matthew 1. Usually we'd be expecting there to be zero women mentioned in it. And the women, see if you recognize any of these names, are Tamar, Rahab, also a prostitute, Ruth, the outsider from Moab, Bathsheba, who David committed adultery with, and Mary, also mentioned in that genealogy, are Judah, Perez, Boaz, Obed, Boaz and Obed, and many others. And all of those people's stories combine into one long family history which stretches all the way back to the beginning and takes us all the way to Jesus and beyond. And so we today in 21st century Bristol, in our own messy and dysfunctional families, are caught up into this bigger story and invited to demonstrate the same extraordinary love that we see time and time and time again through the pages of the Bible. And so whatever it is that you are facing today and in your own family and with those whom you see as family, may God give you the strength to keep on loving them. Keep on serving. Keep on with those selfless acts of compassion. Not that are going to send you beyond the edge of what you can cope with or beyond boundaries that need to be retained. But keep on with the compassion and the kindness because all of that will be used by God for his good purposes in ways that we may never see or realize during our lifetimes. So well done, good and faithful servants. Keep going. Thanks Gemma. Let's just have a moment, shall we, as we enter into our prayer time now."

    "transcript": "is taken from Ruth chapter 4 verses 13 to 22. So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. When they came together the Lord made her conceive and she bore a son. Then the woman said to Naomi, Blessed be the Lord who has not left you this day without next of kin and may his name be renowned in Israel. He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age. For your daughter-in-law who loves you who is more to you than seven sons has borne him. Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her bosom and became his nurse. The women of the neighborhood gave him a name saying, A son has been born to Naomi. They named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse, the father of David. Now these are the descendants of Peres. Peres became the father of Hezron. Hezron of Ram. Ram of Aminadab. Aminadab of Nanson. Nanson of Salmon. Salmon of Boaz. Boaz of Obed. Obed of Jesse. And Jesse of David. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Thank you Jonathan. Sorry there was some trickiness at the end of that. You did very well. It's great. I don't think none of us know how to pronounce any of these names. So if I pronounced them differently it's not because Jonathan did it wrong. It's just because we don't truly know. Today's talk is called Hope for God's People in the Story of Ruth and Today. Let's pray. Lord thank you that you are a God who opens the way for each of us into a future that is filled with hope. Help us to hear from you now. And where there are things about our thought lives or our actions that need to change so that they are better aligned with your hope-filled future. I pray that your spirit would help us to do that. In your name we pray. Amen. I've realized that not everybody will have been here for each of the talks throughout the series of Ruth. But right back at the beginning on the 19th of October when we kicked this off Julie was setting the scene for us and helping us to see that the story of this small seemingly insignificant family begins with the main characters going through a really tough time. But what I want to do is just to briefly zoom out a little bit further than that and consider what's going on for the whole of God's people, the Israelites, at this point in history when we meet Naomi and Ruth. Because as we do that we're going to discover that things were kind of perhaps even more bleak than we realized. So you can think back in terms of the history of God's people back to the Exodus, the escape from Egypt that was led by Moses and then as Moses died Joshua took over as the leader of the Israelites and finally 80 years after they escaped from Egypt they are settled in the land of Canaan and Joshua has died and so the people are now kind of entering into this period of time where they're in the promised land they are in that sense a settled nation but they don't really have a kind of an overall ruler. And the book of the Bible that we find this period of history in is called Judges and what we see is that there are leaders who were appointed by God who came and kind of rose up and rescued God's people every time they found themselves in a state of crisis. Judges makes for fairly bleak reading it has to be said. God's people go round in a cycle they start off disobeying God and then God causes them to be oppressed by neighbouring nations and tribes and so eventually because things have got worse for them they cry out to God and they say God help us give us a leader and God does that and a judge is kind of raised up and a victory is won and the good times return and then the people start disobeying God again and then the cycle begins again. And in the middle of that 400 years of that cycle happening again and again we find this story of Ruth and Naomi and Boaz. And as we've looked at it over the last few weeks I've been struck by the ways that God generously meets the needs of this little family. Physically their needs relationally and by ensuring that they have a future hope and for this family that means an heir a male in the family line. And we shouldn't be surprised that God does this that he faithfully provides for this family because on so many of the pages of scripture we see the same story. God is showing up in fragile desperate situations and he's using his faithful people to bring about hope and to turn things around. And it also shouldn't be surprising that there was difficulty and bleakness for God's people as a nation and also for this particular family because we know don't we that as human beings we're not immune to difficult things. Daily life is tough sometimes and sometimes it's a bit easier but our relationship with God can be constant through that. And so today what I'd want to do is two things really is to show how we see God's generous provision at work in the story of Ruth and then just to spend a little bit of time maybe more than I might usually to think particularly about our church here and maybe about half of you have read some emails that have gone out this week but I'll explain a bit more about what was communicated in those because we're in a particular season here as a church family at the moment. One where we do have some needs and where we might feel like things are a little bit fragile but God's going to help us to navigate those just in the same way that he helped Ruth and Naomi to navigate their own situation. So first we meet Naomi and her daughters-in-law Ruth and Orpah after they've suffered three bereavements in close succession and they're almost starving due to the famine in Moab where they were living. Naomi is an Israelite from Bethlehem but her faith in God seems really shaky at the beginning of the story and that's not surprising is it when we think of the trauma that she's experienced. Ruth and Orpah are Moabites so not Israelites but Ruth at least seems to have come to share the faith of her mother-in-law Naomi her faith in the God of Israel. And so Naomi and Ruth in chapter one arrive back into Naomi's hometown of Bethlehem. They're desperately hungry, they're feeling pretty hopeless but in this small yet significant town lives some faithful people including Boaz, a distant relative of Naomi's late husband. And chapter two outlined for us the ways in which Boaz is used by God to provide some of the things that these two women who had literally nothing needed in the short term. Suddenly their situation is a little less fragile and a little bit more hopeful. Their immediate need of food to fill their bellies is met through Boaz's gifts of grain, his generous gifts of grain and his willingness to let Ruth glean in his fields during the harvest. But he also helps them to find their place again within this community. He treats them kindly. You can't underestimate the value of kind actions and he protects them through the power that he has because he's a prominent nobleman in the town. That was chapter two. Chapters three and four are much more about that longer term security and purpose that these women...\n\nneeded if they were going to be able to survive long term. And what Boaz does is he generously and honorably navigates all the things that need to be done in order that he might take Rufus's wife and in doing so secure Naomi's future and the future of her husband Elimelech's line, family line, by giving Ruth a son called Obed. And just last week as we paused in the middle of chapter four, Obed had just been born to Ruth and to Boaz. But in the bit that we heard today, something extraordinary happens. It seems that what Ruth and Boaz did was they gave Obed to Naomi. And that isn't just a kind of a, oh here hold him for a minute or be a helpful granny. I'm sure there are lots of them in the room. It says she took him to her breast and she became his nurse. And it is specifically the Hebrew word for wet nurse that is used here. And then in verse 17, the women of Bethlehem declare Naomi has a son. It wasn't Naomi's son. It was Ruth's son. But they're declaring Naomi has a son. I did some maths and tried to kind of work out how old was Naomi. I decided that she was probably about my age. I'm 42. Theoretically could still have a child. So she could have actually done this. This isn't something that was kind of beyond her physiology. But it was beyond what would have been expected of Ruth and Boaz because Obed was theirs. And yet they give him to Naomi. Naomi came back to Bethlehem utterly empty after all those years of living in Moab. Devastated by the death of her husband and her two sons. Depleted through hunger and her faith in God had all but deserted her too. And now at the end of this story, four chapters and probably less than a year after it began, here she is completely and utterly full. Her physical needs have been provided for. She's surrounded by a loving family and a wider supportive community and her arms are full of this bundle of hope that is Obed. A son entrusted to her against all the odds. And there's something else extraordinary in this last little bit of Ruth 4. And that is what the women of Bethlehem proclaim over Ruth. They say Ruth is worth more than seven sons to Naomi. That is astonishing. The number seven is astonishing in and of itself. A really significant number. It kind of means worth more than as many sons as you could imagine really. But in a culture where male heirs were the ones that would have all the rights and all the status, Ruth is actually being likened to the great matriarchs of God's people, Rachel, Leah, Tamar, the others. These are the ones whose stories along with their husbands have been passed down and told throughout the generations. And now the women of Bethlehem are saying Ruth's going to be one of those as well. And she is because here we are reflecting on her story in 2025. Ruth, the foreigner from Moab, Moab becoming a woman, a symbol even of hope. And the genealogy at the end of the book reminds us that Ruth's son Obed becomes the father of Jesse. And if we were to think ahead to the book of 1 Samuel, we would find Samuel, the boy, the one who God called to in the night and he runs and he says, I can hear from God. Samuel becomes the prophet, the last of the judges, who then as an adult goes to Jesse's house and finds Jesse's sons, all seven of them. And then they realize, oh no, there's an eighth, the runt of the litter. It basically says that. And that eighth son is David. And God says to Samuel, anoint him. He's going to be the king, the king of Israel, the one after my heart. And so through that, the time of the judges with that perpetuating bleak cycle draws to an end and a new chapter, a new season begins for God's people when they're being ruled over by a king appointed by God and their communal worship becomes centered around the temple in Jerusalem. That bleak cycle in the book of Judges must have been a time where God's faithful people were crying out to him, prayers of when are you going to intervene, Lord? Make known your plans for your people. I wonder when we last prayed that prayer. I pray it quite often about all sorts of different things. When are you going to intervene, Lord? Come on. It's 2025. The world should be better than it is. And then those prayers are answered through this very ordinary family dealing with their own set of very difficult circumstances, a family line that seems extremely fragile, set to die out. But God makes a way. And what looks impossible to them is not impossible for him because where God is, there is hope. Hope for the future. And Jesus came and said famously in John 10.10, I've come that you might have life and have it abundantly or have it to the full, that you might know fullness of life. But I wonder how often we make a connection in our mind with the fullness of life and thinking it's full of good things. My life, I'm experiencing fullness of life if nothing difficult is happening. We might find ourselves in that situation, but that is not what Jesus meant. It's not what having hope in God is like. Fullness of life is a life that is full of good things and the challenging things that all of us face. And that is true for us personally. And I know that lots of you are going through difficult things at the moment. And it's true for us as a community, as a church. And the two different bits of communication that kind of went out this week, one was about people and one was about our services in 2026. And the other big factor, as I mentioned at the beginning, is that the building work on our hall is about to begin. And all of those things together might make us feel like, as we think about 2026 for our church, it's uncertain. We're dealing with scarcity. Things feel fragile. But I actually don't feel that. I feel excited about the coming year. But the facts remain that due to all kinds of things outside of our control, if we were to look back at the size of our kind of ministry and staff team five years ago, this time five years ago, and compare it to what it will be like at the beginning of 2026, it's now less than half the size it was, which was quite a startling thing for me to realize. Our finances as a church are in a more fragile position now than they have been since I became vicar here six years ago. And our reserves are set to run out this year. They will run out. We're having to reduce our expenditure in all kinds of ways. We're having to put some of our missional activities that we love to be able to offer on hold because of the developments on the church rooms. And we might justifiably worry, is that going to kind of make people think we don't care about them? They're going to think St. Mary's isn't there for them anymore.\n\nBut in the midst of all of those things, God is at work. And we have a hope-filled future. And even though we might view these things negatively, God can bring good out of them. And I am generally a very positive person. I always try and focus on the positives. So I want to give you some positives about our church at the moment. The first is that we're growing. And that's amazing. New people are kind of here each week wanting to worship with us. And not all of them are sticking and coming back. But some of them are. And some of those might be you here. And there are signs of what's being called nationally the quiet revival. We're seeing signs of that here. People just turning up and feeling a spiritual hunger that maybe they can't even really explain. That's like drawing them into church. And we want to say, God, would you bless that? Bring it on. Because we're ready to welcome people who are searching spiritually and to help them explore what Christianity means and what it looks like to follow Jesus. As we change in our kind of team and other people that kind of lead in different ways, what we're seeing is people stepping up to serve. And that's wonderful. And if that's you, thank you. Because it's awesome. It's awesome that we can be a family where everyone's kind of got something that they're like, yeah, that's my role. That's sort of one of the things that I do here to kind of bless the church family. I spent some time this week remaking all of the little name labels that we've had for a long time, but they needed updating. And I looked at it and I thought, right, I'm going to do everybody that's on a rota or a team. And that was about 130 people ranging from our teenagers all the way through to people in their 90s. Yeah. And that's awesome. And they're over there at the back. And if you're on a rota or a team and you haven't got one, please come and tell me. I will make you one quick as a flash. And I'd love to see it that actually everybody who calls this church their church has a name label because they're on some kind of rota or a team and doing something to contribute to the life of the church. And part of what we're going to be doing in 2026 is really continuing to invest in relationships. And the very first step towards that is knowing people's names. And so if you are here in the building doing something in the week or on Sunday, wear your name label because that will just like really help people to start to get to know you. And you'll start spotting people with their names on as well. And hopefully that will just be a good way in to begin to get to know each other better. And then the second big thing that was communicated was about our services and how in 2026 we are going to be having one 10 o'clock service every Sunday morning. And it's going to alternate in style between this format for our 1030s and our nine o'clock format. So on the weeks when it's like a 1030, we'll have our wonderful band and we'll have our Shine on Sundays groups and we'll probably use some videos and it will feel familiar to those of you that are familiar with this service. And then on week B, we'll have the choir who bless us at nine o'clock every week and the organ. And it will feel much more like the nine o'clock does now. And I really, really hope that lots of you will still come on week B. And those of you who don't come in the morning on week B might like to come along to explore at four, which will be in the afternoon on those weeks. And it is going to be a compromise. It is change. But God's with us in it. And it's going to help us to navigate what could be on paper a complicated year. But we're investing in the future of this church through our relationships with each other, through the finances that we need to keep doing all the things that we want to do and through future proofing building. And it will be worth it in the end, even though it might be a bumpy ride at times. And so in the story of Ruth, God is taking this fragile family and he's blessing them through the generosity of Boaz and the people of Bethlehem. And what he's doing is securing the future leadership of the people of the nation of Israel through the family line of Obed. And I really believe that God's going to do the same for St Mary's. The church has been through challenges in the past. It will go through challenges again in the future. And God is going to help us navigate this coming year with its challenges and its joys. And he will continue to remind us of his hope. And the seeds of that hope are all around us and within us, as they always have been."

    "transcript": "There's some popcorn in the youth corner, so if anyone wants to go and accompany the young people, they can come and eat some popcorn. There's a rapidly diminishing bag of popcorn there. You're like, get it in. Get it in now before the greedy grown-ups arrive. Okie dokie. Marvellous, marvellous. Great. Oh, you're a very good-looking bunch this afternoon. Anyway, last week, Ryan kicked us off talking about a really central biblical idea about God being our loving Father. Whatever our relationship with our earthly dad might be, God wants to know and relate to us as a father. It was a really wonderful time together. It was a really wonderful message. If you missed it, I do recommend you catch up on the podcast, but I would recommend having a glass of water and a box of tissues with you. I thought Ryan was going to dehydrate at one stage last week, so you might want to rehydrate halfway through the message. But no, seriously, it was wonderful, so please do check it out. As Ryan said last week, this is a really huge topic. It's something which people will do entire Christian conferences on. So realistically, what we can achieve in half an hour on a Sunday afternoon is not masses. But we're also aware that this is really hallowed ground for many of us, that our relationship with our dads, for some of us, has been problematic. For some of us, it's complicated or painful. So we also want to tread very carefully this afternoon as well. But we do think it's really important to go here, even if this is a place of pain for us, because we believe that this is also a place where we can find enormous amounts of freedom and wholeness and hope. Amen? And so as Ryan said last week, we may only really have time in these sessions to kind of take the first steps on a journey of healing. But if there's any way that we as a church can love and support you as you want to take continual steps on that journey, please do talk to your home group leaders or talk to anybody in a position of leadership within the church. We'd love to talk to you about how we could kind of facilitate some onward steps on that journey. And so today I'm going to try and pick up where Ryan left off. I'm going to be exploring some of what it means to actually have God as our Father. And as I've been mulling this passage over over the last couple of weeks, there's a little bit at the beginning of the biography of Jesus' life written by one of his apprentices called John. And it's been kind of rattling through my brain. It's describing Jesus and it says this. To all who believed in him and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God. They are reborn. Not with a physical birth resulting from human passion or plan, but a birth that comes from God. Anybody ever read that before? Heard that before? Is that familiar to anybody? It's okay. It's okay if it's not. It's okay if it's not. And so I've been kind of meditating on that. I've been kind of chewing those little phrases over in my head. Being born again, being reborn, being born into a family called children of God, brought into a family by choice, a birth that comes from God, a new beginning, not based on human passion or family planning. And I've been mulling over and thinking, it's a really strange idea. It's a really strange idea to like be born, reborn a second time, and this time into a completely different family. Like can you imagine how strange and disorientating that would be? Like imagine if someone was reborn into your family of origin. Like all of a sudden you've got a new brother or sister and you're like, hi, who the heck are you? Like strange. But imagine if that was your experience as well. Like if you came into somebody else's family, like it would be a strange experience, right? Yeah? Anybody with me? Thank you. It would be a strange experience. Like there'd be a whole load of stuff that you'd want to, you'd need to catch up on. Like I wonder like what weird and wonderful family traditions would you need to introduce this new person to? Like what awkward family secrets would you need to just kind of take them to one side and say, hey, weird aunt Sarko, no, like you'd have to have that conversation, wouldn't you? Like what relational dynamics might need explaining to your newly arrived siblings? For example, if someone got reborn into my household right now, there's a handful of things that we would need to explain. One of them is the sheer quantity of board games present in the building and an expectation that any free time will be spent playing the said board games. Secondly, there'd need to be a briefing about exactly how to talk to great grandma, what to say, what not to say, how to get into her good books and how to stay there. Very important. We'd also need to talk about the very important unspoken sock policy that exists in our household. We have a certain way that we like to remove our socks in our house. It involves stretching your sock up as high as you can on your leg and then kind of methodically rolling it down your foot until you get to the bottom and you make a little kind of sock token. That's a polite way of referring to them. We call them something slightly less polite in our house. And these little sock tokens get dotted around our house and whoever is doing the laundry that week gets to unpick the slightly crispy sock tokens off the floor before going in the washing machine. Apparently that's how we like to do things in our household. But there we go. That's too much information. So what I'd like you to do is get into those little groups with the people around you and just discuss if somebody was coming into your family of origin or your household at the moment, what would be the things that would be important to give them a quick briefing on? Or maybe you want to flip it the other way around. If you were the person going into someone's family, what would you want to tell them about yourself? For example, I'm a massive introvert and I can't do anything until I've had a cup of coffee. Stuff like that. It doesn't have to be deep and meaningful. Keep it light and whatever. Only share what you feel comfortable sharing. But take a couple of minutes with the people around you and then we'll report back. So on your marks, get set, go. Okie dokie. Let's hear from some of you guys. What would be some of the things about your family or about yourself that you feel would be important to share if you were suddenly introduced into a new family? I'm going to come over to the youth sofa first. Pray silence for the youth home group. What would you need to share or say? Like how different people act. Like in my family, people have different looks. So you've got to know which look means what, right? Very good. Okay. Who else has got one? Go on, Eileen. What have you got? To put things back where they come from. No, that's not important. It is when you can't see. That's true. That's true. If you're partially sighted, things going back where they came from is very important. I'll give you that, Eileen. Okay. Okay, here we go. Here we go. So me and Geoffrey share this one. If you come to my house, you may think everybody's fighting, but in reality, we're just trying to get hurt and it's a form of love. So very, very loud conversation style. Very good. What else? Who else have we got? Diddly dee. Yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh, here we go. Yeah, I have to tell people what happens when they pull my finger. What does happen when? No, I don't want to know. No, actually, no. Let's not go there. Let's not go there. Okay, that's quiet enough of that. It's not long before someone lowers the tone, right? Like, it's not long. Okay, thanks for sharing. So as I said, as I was meditating on this passage that we heard in chapter one of John, this idea of being reborn into God's family, like, called the child of God, this idea of being reborn into a new family. It's a kind of strange and clunky concept. But there is an elegant and much more simple word that we use for this idea. When someone gets added into a family from outside, gets all the benefits of being a fully-fledged member of the household, what's that? Adoption. Absolutely right. And luckily, there are other places in our Bibles which use this language of adoption into God's family. And really, this is the point where Ryan left us off last week. God wants to reach out to us as a loving father and adopt us into his family, to heal us and restore us, make us whole, and walk out the rest of our lives alongside him in a loving relationship. And so today, I just want to spend a bit of time exploring that idea and asking, what does that actually mean? Like, what does it actually look like in my everyday life? How should that idea impact the way that I think about myself and think about the world around me? Or if I'm still making my mind up about saying yes to Jesus, about the idea of being adopted into God's family, saying a big yes to Jesus and calling myself a follower of Jesus or a Christian, like, what am I getting myself in for? Another thing I did in preparation for today was I read Ben Britton's Masters. No, yeah, your Masters, that's right. Give us a wave, Ben. There he is. So I read Ben's Masters, which was really good. Your dissertation. I thought it was good. And I didn't just read it for the fun\n\nSince we are united with Christ, we have received an inheritance from God, for he chose us in advance, and he makes everything work out according to his plan. Come on. That's a shot in the veins, right? Like, drink a cup of coffee in the morning, or read that. Like, that's absolutely amazing, right? So there we see the idea of God adopting us into his family, and a whole bunch of other stuff besides. And we're going to do a real deep dive on this passage, but before we do, let's just really quickly define what we mean by adoption. Shall we? Like, first thoughts that comes to mind when we think about adoption. What do we mean by adoption? Or more likely, when we talk about adoption, what do we picture? So I'd like to hear from you in this moment. Who gets adopted? Children, very good. How old are those children? Under 18, yeah. Under 18, so we're thinking small children, medium-sized children, big children. What do we think? Generally speaking? Generally speaking, small children. Right. And why would they get adopted? Whole bunch of circumstances, right? Like, loads of reasons why. Who does the adopting? What kind of people adopt? Who adopts children? Nice people, yeah. Can anyone adopt, generally speaking? If you can go through the checks and all that stuff, yes, absolutely. Very good. Here's one big question. Who benefits from the adoption? Like, who's the primary beneficiary? Who benefits? The child, right? That's the biggest benefit, lands with the child, absolutely. So that's one of our modern understandings of adoption, isn't it? That's what we picture. We picture small children being adopted by families. But what Paul's readers would have pictured would have been ever so slightly different. It's very close, but it's not identical. So in Roman culture, at the time, adoption was something that only upper-class people could really do. They were the only people who could afford to do it. They were the only ones who could manage it. Middle class or working class people would be struggling to get by, so adding another mouth to feed was actually quite a bad idea. In fact, many families would sell their children into slavery if they couldn't get by. Ouch. Brutal, right? But a little bit more cash in the bank, one less mouth to feed, very brutal. Furthermore, it wouldn't have been common at all for small children to be adopted. In fact, you looked to actually adopt somebody who was a little bit older. The reality was that infant mortality rates were really, really high, so only about 50% of children survived through childhood, and only 40% of them would reach adulthood. So when considering adopting a child and feeding and investing in them, the younger you adopted somebody, the riskier the investment. You might well be motivated by compassion to adopt a young child from a deprived background, therefore increasing their chance of survival, but very, very few families would have done that. And the main reason for that is that Roman adoptions had a motivation that we don't really think about. Roman citizens would have adopted children into their family because they saw it as an opportunity and an advantage to do so. Think of it like this. I'm a wealthy Roman citizen. I've got loads of cash. I've had a few children, and I hope to pass my vast wealth and businesses on to my children. But because I'm minted, I've basically given my kids everything that they've ever wanted. If they've wanted it, they've been given it. They've never had to work for anything, and now they're in their mid-20s. How are these children? They're spoiled, right? We've got some spoiled brats living in the house, and I'm looking at them, and I'm like, I'm not going to pass my business on to them because I'm not an idiot. Like, I've worked hard for this. I can't pass this on to you. So I have a bit of a problem. Oh, wrong page. Sorry. So I'm also frankly embarrassed by my children because they're wandering around town. They've got my surname, and they're bringing my name into disrepute. So something needs to be done about this. What can I do if the children that are going to be my heirs are spoiled brats or worse, females? Because that would be worse, wouldn't it? I could go through the motions of starting to discipline my children in their early 20s, start to bring them into line and form some decent character in them. Obviously, that's not going to work if they're females. Like, no amount of hard work and discipline is going to solve that problem. Don't come at me. It's the Romans. It's okay. We're going to be okay. I thought there'd be some titters of laughter there, but there was just like a wall of hostility that came at me. I was like, no, Emily, it hasn't worked. They didn't get it. I'm sorry, I did look at you. I thought you're now my only friend in the room, so I had to look at you. Anyway, so you can either try and bring some discipline into their lives in the early 20s, or you can take a shortcut. You could write off those biological kids as a loss, and you could look to adopt a nice, healthy young man in his teens who's managed to survive to this stage. You could grab one like this, and you could just bring him into your family like this. Very good. Thank you. Now, he's worked a nice manual job most of his life, so he's got really good muscles. Have you? Oh. He's got great teeth. Look at those teeth. They are good teeth, right? He's got good teeth, but he's also worked hard, so he's got good character. He's got very, very good character. And if I adopt you into my wealthy household, you're going to work really hard and be grateful, aren't you? Yes. Good lad. Very good. Thank you very much. You can go and sit down. So I can trust this lad. So I could adopt Theo because he's young. I can shape his mind, and I can shape his character and his understanding. And he's not a girl. Ha! I got one more in. Anyway, in this way, I get what I want. My family name lives on in safe hands, and my hard work is passed on to somebody that I can trust. That is what Roman adoption looks like. And it happened all the time. It was really well recognized. In fact, the last handful of Roman emperors had actually been appointed in this way. The previous emperor had adopted somebody into the family and appointed that person as their son. So this dynamic was really well known, well established, and popular. And this, this is the kind of adoption that Paul was talking about in that passage that we read. When Paul talks about adoption, he's not thinking about our idea of adoption. He's thinking about this Roman idea of adoption. So let's just read it again one more time, but with that picture in our minds. It says, All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms, because we are united with Christ. Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes. He decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. Bit of a mind blower there, right? He's saying that before any of us were born, even before the world was created, before a single blade of grass was formed, he knew about each of us. He chose to adopt us, to bring us into his family. And then it goes on to say this, This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure. Just pause here. We're going to come back here. Fix this little phrase in your mind. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure. This is the truest truth. Most of us don't believe this. We're going to come back here. Remember what I just said about Roman adopters and think about that little phrase. And so we praise God for the glorious grace, the amazing gift that he has poured out on us who belong to his dear son. He is so rich in kindness and grace that he purchased our freedom with the blood of his son and forgave our sins. He has showed his kindness to us along with all wisdom and understanding. So here we go. This is what it means to be with Christ. We're kind of unpacking that idea of united with Christ, in Christ. He's talking about what Jesus achieved by his death and his resurrection. He's pointing to that moment that we celebrate each week with communion, that Jesus died, was buried, and was raised to life again for us and for the world. That because of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, we can associate ourselves with Jesus and say, I want to do that too. I want to die to my old life and to be raised to a new life. And that's what Paul's talking about. He's talking about being united with Jesus in death and his resurrection and being raised to a new life. Furthermore, because we are united with Christ, we've received an inheritance from God, for he chose us in advance and he makes everything work out according to his plan. So do you kind of hear that story emerging? Do you see that story of adoption that's emerging there? God had a big master plan, a plan in place before the dawn of time, a plan to adopt us into his family through his son, Jesus, a plan that he was delighted to play out, which gave him great joy. Like this is that adoption and it's free to us. We cannot earn it. And it's going to result in an inheritance. It's amazing, right? We're going to take a couple of minutes back in those little groups\n\nSo get back into those little groups and just talk very briefly. What stood out, and especially when you think about the idea of Roman adoption, where the person who does the adopting kind of has the advantage. Go for it. So in general, when we picture adoption, we picture a small child desperately in need of love and care who needs protecting and providing for. And when we think about God adopting us, that is certainly true. But what's also true at the same time is this other definition of adoption that Paul's readers would have recognized. That in adoption, the person who does the adopting is the one who is seen to be benefiting. They are the ones that win in that arrangement. The benefit lands with the adopter. And we see this is true because of what Paul says in that passage that we read. I don't know if you caught it. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure. What Paul is laying before us here is a picture of God the Father as a wealthy, influential adopter who is choosing to adopt children into his family because he sees something in them that delights him. This is kind of different to our idea of adoption, right? When we think about adoption, we think about the benefit landing with the one who is adopted. And when you're adopted, hopefully the move into a new family life, it's a life which is better, more secure, with better prospects than the one you came from. And whilst mostly that would have been true for those in the Roman system too, from a social perspective, it would have been seen that the one who benefited most from the adoption was the one who did the adopting. That adoption was a strategic and beneficial move by the adopter. We don't think like that, do we? But Paul's readers would have thought exactly like that. So imagine the power of hearing this read to you with that truth in your mind. Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes. God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure. Sometimes this kind of gets lost in our English translations, and it's lost in this passage too, where it says he chose us for adoption. It would be more helpful to say something like, he chose us for adoption to sonship. That language of sonship is that thing that I've just described, that process of choosing someone to adopt to be a primary heir, to be the one who inherits the farm and who bears the family name. The best thing about being adopted into God's family is that God the Father is not sexist like much of the Roman Empire was. The kingdom of God is for both men and women. Both men and women are adopted and full name-bearing, inheritance-receiving heirs. Just because Paul borrows a bit of language of sonship that was recognizable at the time, there's no reason why we can't read the verse as, God decided in advance to adopt us into daughtership and sonship by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. Guys, when we think about God adopting us into his family, adopting us as sons and daughters into the inheritance we're supposed to have, this little refrain is meant to be ringing in our ears. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure. When we think about our adoption into the family of God, we're supposed to understand that God wanted to adopt us so much that adding us into his family was a strategic advantage to him. That by you and I being adopted into the family, he won. He benefited. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure. Guys, this is what it means to be adopted by Father God. This is what it means to be reborn into God's family. Not a birth resulting from passion or plan, but a birth that comes from God. Paul is inviting us to believe that before the creation of the world, God knew us. That he planned to adopt us into his family. That he has an inheritance for us. That he didn't adopt us out of duty or pity or obligation, nor did he kind of adopt us en masse along with innumerable other humans, just another face in the crowd. No, Paul says that he knew us in advance. He planned for each of us and that it gave him great pleasure to adopt us one by one. Who believes that? Good for you. I struggle with that. Big time. Can you imagine how we would live if we believed that? Like if we lived our lives as if that was true, can you imagine? Like if I could know that God loves me so much that he adopted me into his family and that he saw that as his advantage? We talked a little bit earlier on about spoiled brats walking around with that kind of air of self-confidence. Like we're supposed to walk around with a sense of confidence because we know who our father is. Like does anybody else find this really difficult to believe? I find this nearly impossible to believe. In fact, if I'm honest, most of the time I walk around thinking that the very opposite is true. When I think about myself being adopted into God's family, I think, wow, God is so good for wanting to adopt me. Honestly, such a generous thing to do. Adopting someone like me must have done so out of sheer pity. Or something like, yeah, God adopted me into his family, but God adopts everyone into his family. Like if they want to be part of it, there's nothing really special about me. I'm just one face in the crowd. Now don't get me wrong, I'm chuffed to be here, but I doubt he even knows my name. Or maybe I think something like, crikey, it cost so much for God to adopt me into his family. I owe him an enormous, enormous debt. I bet he's really angry with me. I better get to work to pay off my debt. Instead, we are dared by Paul to adopt and explode our understanding here. He is not allowing us to hold any of those mindsets. This is a huge part of my personal walk with God and my journey so far. I'm one of those people who's been extremely blessed to have a really great dad. Not a perfect dad. Nobody has the perfect dad, but my dad, sorry, he sat just over there, which is why there's a sorry. You weren't under the impression that you were perfect. Sorry. We'll have this conversation later. I'm going to start that again. I'm one of those people who is extremely blessed to have a really great dad. Yeah? Amen. He's not perfect, but nobody has a perfect dad. But my dad is one of the really good ones. Some of you know that to be true. But even though my relationship with my dad has been pretty plain sailing and unproblematic, the idea of adoption has always tripped me up. I came across this really a couple of years ago when a wise friend asked me, how do you relate to God? I thought to myself, I've never, ever been asked that question before. What a strange question. I said, what does your relationship with God look like? Like, who is he and who are you? And it was such a funny question, I had to go away and think about it. But I came back and ended up saying, I feel like God is my boss. God is my boss and I love working for him. I want to work really hard for my boss that I love and I want to earn a lovely bonus. I want to get promotion. I want to get affirmation and recognition, not to mention a lovely paycheck and a hefty bonus for doing a good job and working hard. Hmm, said my wise friend. And then she asked me, what about relating to God as a father who just loves you and has an inheritance for you regardless of what you can do for him? What if God's adopted you into his family and loves you and it gives him great pleasure to do so? Strangely, I find that a little bit harder to get on board with. And all of a sudden I found myself rationalizing left, right and center and going through that list of excuses I just mentioned. Well, if God did adopt me, it was likely by the skin of my teeth. He was probably tutting and rolling his eyes as I walked in through the door saying, go on then, you might as well come in. Or it was completely based on duty. Clearly I was so depraved and lowly that he adopted me out of sheer duty. He didn't want to, but he was almost compelled to because that's kind of the guy that he is. He's supposed to be loving and that would be the right thing to do. Or maybe he actually didn't notice me coming into the family at all because he accepts everyone. He just swung open the gates and I just kind of snuck in technically. He might even not know that I'm here. All of these mindsets lead me to a place where I want to earn my way into God's favor or I want to hide from his close attention. It becomes difficult for me to think about God knowing who I am. And even though I know I'm technically part of his family, I don't think of myself as a dearly loved son. And yet this is what God says about me and about you. God decided in advance to adopt us into daughtership and sonship by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do and it gave him great pleasure. Em, would you come and join me? That'd be great.\n\nWhy don't we stand together if you'd like to? We're going to have a little time of response. If you feel comfortable, you can close your eyes. You can pop your hands out as if you're about to receive a gift. That's what we sometimes do to just kind of tell our bodies what we would like our minds to understand. Let's just kind of key into God's presence in the room. I don't really know how adoption works. I'm sure someone who's much more sensible than me can correct me later. But in my head, adopting parents are kind of given a catalogue of kids, like Argos, and they can kind of flip through the catalogue and choose one they might like. I imagine seeing Father God flipping through that catalogue and my profile comes up, or your profile comes up. Just imagine your picture coming up on that page. Your name, your history to this date, your likes and your dislikes, your temperament, your neurodiversity, your learning difficulties, your health issues, your temper, your shame, your insecurities. Everything about your family of origin, your gender identity, your sexual orientation, your history of addiction. I would imagine that for most of us, we would assume that adoptive parents might take one look at us and turn the page and go looking for a kid with less baggage, a little less of a handful, a little bit more X, a little bit less Y. I imagine most of us might have a list of things quite high up in our minds. The reason why Father God might want to turn the page on our profiles. And we just want to stand together as a church and say that that list that comes to the forefront of our mind is a list of lies. The good news, the crazy news is that for each of us, Father God has looked at our profile. He knows us more deeply than we will ever know ourselves. He sees us, all the hairs on our heads, warts and all, and he says, I will adopt them. And it gives him great pleasure. And then he turns the page and he looks at another picture, another profile, and he says, I'll adopt them. And it gives him great pleasure. He doesn't just hand the catalogue back and say, don't waste my time, I've got other things to do, I'll just take the lot. The Father knows each of us by name. He knows all the hairs on our heads and he chooses us, each of us, by name and is delighted to do so. Holy Spirit, we welcome you here to come and speak that truth deeply into our hearts. Holy Spirit, we invite you to come and speak louder than that list of lies, that list of reasons why we think the Father wouldn't want to adopt us. Come, Holy Spirit, and speak to our hearts. I mentioned earlier on there'd be a moment to share any prophetic words or words of encouragement, any words of knowledge that we might have. If anybody does have anything, this is the moment to share it. But I'm going to say we are standing on hallowed ground, and so think about your use of language when you come up. But you're very welcome if anybody would like to come up and share anything they feel God has said to be an encouragement, this is the moment to come forwards. At the start of the service I had a picture of a barbed wire fence, and just as Daniel was just been speaking around speaking to our hearts, I had a sense for some people there's some pain or something around your relationship with fathers and things like that, that you just put barbed wire around your heart. And the great news of this picture was God was able to go through that fence. It wasn't about you having to remove it first. God can work even through the things we just try and suppress and put away. So be encouraged, he's working, even in those painful places, even if you aren't able to go there yet yourself, he's working. I was thinking about the prodigal son and how the father runs to the son who repents and turns back. And so I had a picture of each of us turning to God and God running towards each of us individually, because it is a one by one thing, it is all of us having that personal relationship, but it is also all of us, and that's what connects us, and that's what makes us brothers and sisters. So the fact that we can all do that ties us together in a powerful way, so that was the sort of picture I saw in the room, so hopefully that's helpful. I get the picture of someone standing and it's dark and there's rain and they can't see anything apart from rain and all this darkness, and they look down and they've got bare feet and they're standing on a rock, and they just know they're not going anywhere because they've got their feet on the rock, and they're not going to fall over, they're fine, they're standing on a rock. Just as we were singing there, I saw a vivid image of a Christmas tree, and what resonated with me is that although we all may be branches, some longer, some shorter, some discoloured, we all get from the same stream of life. And no matter your circumstance, where you come from, who you are, where you will become, we're all the same, and that the tree will continue to grow no matter who you are. Anybody else? It's not too late. We had one final one from our friend Annie, who texted me this morning, she said she was praying for our gathering, and she said she felt God say, never once did he leave you, did he leave us on our own. Never once did he leave us on our own. And so we're just going to respond in a handful of ways now. Emily's going to lead us in singing our final song, and it might well be that we want to sit in a moment of prayer and reflection, it might be that we want to sing this from the top of our lungs, it might be that you'd like somebody to come and stand with you, to pray with you with what's going on. Maybe one of those particular words or something else has really resonated with you and you'd appreciate somebody coming and standing with you. So that's something that we do in this church, we love to pray with people. And so as Emily leads us in one final song, if you want to move out to the space on the right or the left over there, and kind of look expectant, then some folks who have been trained to pray will come and stand with you and pray with you. GBC folks, this is a reminder of how we pray for people. Remember, we always ask consent twice. We say, may I pray for you? And we always ask before we place our hands on people, we don't presume that. And really we're just letting the person take the lead. So they might want to share something with us and say, that picture really resonated with me. They might want to say nothing at all, in which case we just want to say thank you, Jesus, for what you're doing and please do more. So let's move into that space now. If you'd like someone to stand with you, make a move out to the side. And Gloucester Vineyard Church people, if you're singing and you look and you see someone standing there, that's you. That's you to go and pray for that person. So let's worship, let's pray with each other. And then in a couple of minutes, we'll wrap things up and head over to the kiddos. Thank you.\n\nI am chosen, not forsaken, I am who say I"

    "transcript": "Good afternoon, everyone. How are we doing? How are we doing? Hello. Am I the only one who's been crying for about half an hour? No, a couple of people. Yeah, thanks, Andrew. Got one of you. Yeah, it's great to be here. My name's Ryan. I'm one of the leaders here at GVC. And this week is five years since my family and I left South Africa to the UK. And we marked it with the good old fish and chips, which has become a tradition in our household. And we just marveled over just the faithfulness of God and just being part of this beautiful family who we really feel called to and we love very dearly. If I'm a little emotional, it's probably because of the subject today and probably also because of my beautiful wife leading worship so well and leading with Carrie and also beautiful Steve. Just had a wonderful time of worship. So if we can stay in that posture today of in our PJs in the living room, that's kind of the vibe today. So I invite you just to kind of relax, let the Father just speak. And yeah, the next two weeks at GVC, we're going to be doing a little mini series together about God, our Father. So Daniel and I are going to be sharing our thoughts about what it means to relate to God as Father, as our Heavenly Father. And now we're aware this is a huge subject. And it's also a sensitive subject for many of us. So we're aware that what we can achieve in these two weeks could only be the first steps in a long and important journey. But we feel that's an important journey that each of us should go on. But because we acknowledge that some of us might appreciate a little bit of space and time and prayer to think about and to pray through this idea for the next two weeks, the kids are going to stay over the road in kids' church to give us a little bit more space, also in their PJs. And at the end of the message to have uninterrupted response time. Is that okay? Awesome. So we all know there is one common character trait amongst all dads. One thing that they universally align with. It's something that evolves over time, gets finessed, much like the dad bod. And you know, of course, I'm talking about the dad joke or the dad jokes. Now I note, I didn't say bad joke. It's a dad joke. Because there is a significant element that makes a dad joke and not a bad joke. That dad is telling it. And it certainly wouldn't be right for me to start this series if I didn't have a couple of pearls ready for you. So you ready? Right, let's go. What do you call a fake noodle? An impasta. Classic, thank you. Dads are laughing. I'm reading a book on anti-gravity. It's impossible to put down. Getting better? Did you hear about the restaurants on the moon? Great food, no atmosphere. Improving? I told my wife she was drawing her eyebrows too high. She looked surprised. And my favourite, I'm so good at sleeping, I can do it with my eyes closed. Come on. My kids tell me that I'm lame. But I'm just a dad. You know, I really love talking about God as our Father. Probably because I'm a dad and I find it one of the most joyous and stretching experiences of my life. It has also brought me no end of joy experiencing God as Father to me personally. I have some great kids. We've got some wonderful kids in this church. Some of you adults we're not sure of. But the kids, truly wonderful. However, as I begin this talk, I want to begin with a couple of disclaimers. This is a really hard subject. Some of us had or have a tricky or even abusive relationship with our dad. Some of us have lost our dads. And so the pangs of grief we feel acutely still. The idea of God as a father, and perhaps not a mother in a cultural context of complicated gender roles, could feel a bit icky. And the concept and makeup of a family sometimes doesn't involve a father at all. So what I don't want to try to do is attempt to deal with all of those subjects today, but rather to explore the relationship with God as a father. What that may look like and how God may wish to explore it with us. Is that okay? It goes without saying that we may have vastly differing experiences with our dads, positive and negative. Our experience may be we've had fathers that were present at football games and nativity plays, and some fathers who didn't show up at Christmas. Fathers who took time to talk to us, really listen. Sorry. Thanks, bro. It's going to be a very long message. Buckle yourself in. Those who were too busy to pay attention. We have some who knew their father as well and some who've never met them. But for better or for worse, and despite the nature of all of these relationships, we all had a dad. My relationship with my dad had been up and down like a roller coaster ride since my folks were separated and eventually divorced when I was 11. My dad was present for our early years and then almost abruptly abandoned us as a family when my folks' relationship broke down. And so we began what we called glibly the silent years of not seeing him, of confusion, of disappointment, all happening during my adolescent years. He then reappeared in our lives in a way when he had found himself a lucrative job in the Middle East and he reentered our lives in my late teens. You see, my dad's self-worth revolved around money and status. I understand now what he was feeling when he couldn't provide for his kids. He had other options, of course, but that mix with a bit of pride meant our formative years were without a present dad. It's no surprise then that I carried with me as a teenager this gaping wound called dad. And to be honest, I'm not sure it really goes away. In fact, some psychologists hold that the absence of a father from a family in all its shapes and forms that it takes does have a major impact on a child and its development. And whilst I don't hang my hat on this type of research as there's lots of criticism between cause and effect, there's enough evidence to suggest that there are connections between absent dads and education attainment, social emotional adjustment, and long-term mental health. I think it's safe to say that this relationship is really important. I also don't want the idea of dad to be all doom and gloom. Many of us have stories of our dads that are filled with joy, memories that we carry with us that form our own parenting and that make us who we are in a really positive way. And it's funny, as I look back, that money, which the absence of my dad made my dad run and hide, also is one of his most praiseworthy attributes. He was incredibly generous, making sure everyone was taken care of when he did have money, always ensuring that he added a decent tip at the end of a meal in a restaurant, and in later years taking all of our family on amazing family holidays. I would love to be as generous as my dad. So as we're talking about dads today and fathers, I think it would be a good time just for us to get into little groups of two or three around you where you're sitting and simply talk a little bit about your dad, if you feel comfortable. Name him. And maybe share some of the characteristics that really stay with you. And don't worry, I'm not going to be asking for any feedback today. This is one of those moments. So in twos and threes, maybe just gather with those around you and share a little bit about your dad if you're comfortable. Sound good? Hope you have had a really good time sharing. I think we can probably agree that the stories of our dad are really, really important and they shape our lives in profound ways, positively and negatively. Right. And so we can't ignore that there is also this possibility that the relationships with our dads have an influence on our relationship with God. You may have seen from my story how money and status were central themes that ran through my dad's life. And to be honest, they are themes where I feel weak and vulnerable too. It's still to this day. These are things that I also bring to God for help, funny enough. I think\n\nWe're all deeply, albeit secretly, searching for the approval of a dad. The I see you. The you're good enough. The I'm proud of you. Of a dad. And I think this is a good thing. That we're all rightly crying out for this affirmation. The affirmation of a faithful father. What if God made it that way? What if the yearning in our hearts is a father God-shaped hole for only him to fill? We look at Jesus' own relationship with God. And this emerges in the Bible primarily as a father. As he walked the earth, he modeled this with his priority always into the secret and quiet place for prayer with his heavenly father. Being separate and alone from the crowd. Jesus' public life begins in a really interesting way. Jesus is heading to the Jordan River where John his cousin is baptizing his disciples. Jesus then asks John to baptize him. And after Jesus comes up from the water, this happens. From Matthew 3.17. And a voice from heaven said, This is my son, whom I love. With him I am well pleased. Tom Wright, the theologian and Greek scholar, uses the words, You are my delight. You see, Jesus needed the I love you and I'm proud of you from his heavenly father. Otherwise, why would God say this to Jesus? Jesus also could have just told his disciples, right? God could have also rather said it to his disciples himself. But no, God the father said to God the son in flesh and perfect, I love you and you are my delight. I suggest that Jesus needed this moment of affirmation from his father. And so we shouldn't be surprised if we crave for this too. And remember that Jesus hadn't done anything yet. At least not publicly. He was the son of a carpenter. So probably had some decent woodwork. He left his parents, had a couple of friends just like us, went to school, probably with some extra rabbi tutoring. Pretty ordinary stuff for those times. And yet God fully loves and approves of him. He's well pleased. He's a delight to his father. And he hadn't done a single miracle. Not a word of prophecy. No sermon on the mount. Nada. I think this is a really challenging part of scripture. And particularly now as a dad of three myself. That I genuinely think are great kids and who I'm genuinely proud of. But if I'm honest, there's a part of me as a father which holds some of that back. That praise and that pride for when they truly accomplish something. And so perhaps we need to rethink the picture of what a good father truly looks like. A father who cares primarily with relationships that he forms with us in that sweet, quiet place. That one-to-one time. Not merely of the things we do for or with them. I'm speaking to myself rarely. We read of Jesus' invitation to all of us into this loving relationship. In Matthew 6, our Lord's Prayer opens not with my father, but our father. This father is for all of us, not just for Jesus. And in case you thought this was a New Testament thing, Isaiah, messenger of God in the Old Testament, says, O Lord, you are our father, we are the clay, and you are our potter. We are all the work of your hand. Isaiah shows a God who is both a creator and a nurturing father. Here to help us and shape our lives, dispelling that tension that we often have between having a God who is creator, king, and lord, as well as a dad. It's worth mentioning that God as father was a revolutionary concept in Jesus' day. As the stories of the Old Testament and prophetic literature were passed down, it's safe to say that many in that time had formed a picture of God that was all-powerful and yet not relationally present, mighty and yet not meek, worshipped from afar and not loved closely. We also encounter many world religions in our day whose gods we could accurately describe as spiritual, having a life force, otherworldly, mystical, and yet perhaps wanting in two crucial elements where the Bible is pronounced, that of being human. We may have heard of the phrase, the imago Dei of God, that we are created in God's image, uniquely and human and relational. And then second, an even more surprising aspect that this God has the nature of a father who would relate with care, with protection, with nurturing. Our God is a proud dad. My dad, Paul Hogarty, passed away a year ago. I was going to have some water quickly to distract myself. He died prematurely in Sri Lanka with his wife. We were thousands of miles away as he lay in a hospital bed where he eventually succumbed to his fourth stroke. He was in ill health and had struggled for many years. His health and care had put a strain on our siblings' relationship with him. He had been far away from support, but he wanted to be in Sri Lanka with his wife, which meant we were detached from him and his deteriorating health, including mental health. Sadly, I don't think he was happy or healthy. I distinctly remember one of our final conversations with each other. And let me add, not all of them were great conversations. He had become quite sentimental in his last few years. And he said to me, my boy, I'm proud of you and how you are with your family. Not like the way I was with you. You have done so well. I don't think we all get many well dones and I'm proud of you moments from our dads. Mine certainly were few and far between. But in a way, this was the redemption of a good, good father. A good God who has swept into the Hogarty family and turned around many of the difficult moments I experienced growing up. I acknowledge my story is still being written. My kids will tell you of all my imperfections. Hey, Ben. I'm learning and trying to redo some of those things I felt were missing from my childhood and add them to my parenting. I'm learning to walk as a faithful son with a faithful heavenly father, learning to trust again and unlearn things from my childhood that no longer apply. Chief of these is that a father only comes into these sacred places of our hearts by invitation. I do believe fathers here today. I do believe he's wanting to take some active steps in our lives. Steps of redemption. Healing. Reordering some foundations. Removing pain and hurt that only he can remove. But this invitation is ours. I've cried many tears and invited the father again and again and again. And he has worked again and again and again. And is working to rearrange the things in my heart where I've had to let go and let God come and do that work. I really sense in the room today there's those turnaround stories waiting to happen. Repairing of those old wounds. Some restoration. Acknowledge these are not things that change overnight. But this moment is part of the journey that God has all of us on. And so I wondered if there could be an invitation from the father to you today. If I can ask Lauren and Kerry to come up if that's okay. We're going to invite the father to come and do some business today.\n\nSo I wonder if I can ask you if you feel comfortable just to close your eyes, to lean back, take that posture like you're sitting in that comfy armchair in your lounge, in your PJs. I really sense the Father here. I just want to acknowledge this is holy ground for many of us. And we don't go there lightly. I just want to acknowledge your story with God the Father and where you are on that journey. You might have just taken your first few steps. You might not have started. You might be 27 years in. But He's still Dad. So perhaps in your mind, just look up to your Heavenly Father. And let the Father look at you. Let Him just be with you a little bit. Your heart may be pounding in your chest. You might be feeling a little bit emotional. That's okay. Tears are healing. That's normal. Just be in that place with the Father. I'd like to take a few moments to just read over some prayerful words I've written down from the Father to you. My darling, my love, I see you. In fact, when I see you, my heart leaps. I just really look forward to spending time with you. There's nothing that you need to do, to bring, to offer, to be more loved by me. And there is nothing you can do that can make me love you less. I just simply love you. I love you the way you are. I always have. I love you the way you are. I always have. I'm actually really proud of you. I love your character, your personality, the unique way you look at the world. It inspires me. It makes me laugh sometimes. But it inspires me. Honestly, it does. And I know we all have our stuff. So bring it here. Leave it with me. Because I just simply love you. You make the world a better place simply by being in it. I'm really sorry for all the pain and hurt, some of which you experienced as a result of earthly fathers. People you trusted who were meant to protect you. I'm really sorry. It was never meant to be that way. I want you to know that you are safe with me. Safe to simply be you. Safe to heal and to let go. Safe to receive all the things I have for you. Only you. So let's take this step by step. I want to show you things you couldn't imagine were possible. You and me. I want to show you how we can turn stories around, your story included. I want to show you right relationships that last, that are meaningful, that are nourishing. I want to be there for you, with you, closer, as we enjoy this life together. I simply love you. I simply love you. I simply love you. It's as simple as that. I simply love you. I simply love you. I simply love you."

    "transcript": "from James 3, verses 13 to 18. Who is wise and understanding among you? Show by your good life that your works are done with gentleness born of wisdom. But if you have better envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not be boastful and false to the truth. Such wisdom does not come down from above, but is earthly and spiritual devilish. For where there is envy and selfish ambition, there will also be disorder and wickedness of every kind. But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits without a trace of partiality. And a harvest of righteousness is shown in peace for those who make peace. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Thank you. So with those words in our minds, let me pose a question for you. Is it possible to be a peacemaker without being a person of peace? There's a question for your Sunday dinner tables perhaps later on. The Nobel Peace Prize is among the world's most prominent international honour. And in recent months, the US President Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire to be awarded it. After failing to receive this accolade in his first term, his obsession with this prestigious award seems to have returned with a vengeance. Indeed, when he was sworn in as President for a second time in January, he made a promise. He said this, my proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and a unifier, he told his audience at home and far beyond. And certainly he has tackled things head on. In a social media post in October, he claimed that he has ended eight wars in just eight months and that he is the President of Peace. His motto, peace through strength, rests on his belief, it seems, that his sheer force of personality, bold threats and even direct telephone calls can end wars. He has said indeed he could end wars in a day. And yet since first becoming President in 2017, Donald Trump has demonstrated that he is capable of both preventing and precipitating armed conflict. The same instincts that lead him to broker agreements can push him to inflame the situation in the belief that only by creating the appearance of imminent disaster will he be able to extract a deal. I hope that ultimately his legacy will be measured not by how often he played the peacemaker, but how long that peace lasted. Clearly, Donald Trump is not the only world leader now or throughout history who has sought to create peace, perhaps because of their own selfish ambition. The tendency for human beings to try to appear to be doing something good whilst harbouring bad motives is an age-old problem. And that's the very thing which James, the writer of the Bible passage that we just heard, was trying to address. He poses this question, he says, what does godly wisdom look like in practice? And then he goes on to answer it by saying that those who are truly wise will be peaceable and will act with gentleness. And he acknowledges that many of us, all of us perhaps, are prone to bitterness, envy and selfish ambition. And that those things, when left unchecked, can cause us to be boastful and to fly close to the wind when it comes to the truth. And he reminds us that where there is envy and selfish ambition, there will also be disorder and wickedness of every kind. And this is just one of many, many passages in the Bible which point out that even though what is within us is hidden, other people can't see it, who we are on the inside really matters. I'm sure we've all had that slightly unpleasant experience of slicing open a piece of fruit only to discover that what looked healthy enough on the outside was actually rotten on the inside. Jesus frequently criticised the most well-behaved people around. They were called the Pharisees. He called them hypocrites for caring more about the appearance of their good works rather than actually having good motives. These were the folk who everyone else looked to as examples of righteous and holy people. I wonder who it is, maybe in your class, maybe in your workplace or your family, who's always well-behaved. I'm sure there will be somebody who you can think of who always seems to be doing the right thing. Well, let me let you into a secret. Even that person who you're picturing in your mind now is not 100% perfect. They will have mixed motives and will sometimes do good things but for the wrong reasons. And this is because none of us can do the right thing all the time. All of us fall short. We are all like that piece of fruit which isn't so tasty looking when you slice it open. And the only alternative, the only way to make that inner change is through God. James describes God's way as wisdom from above. He says it's pure, it's peaceful, it's gentle, it's willing to yield. It's full of mercy and good fruits and without a trace of partiality or hypocrisy. Does that describe you 100% of the time? It certainly doesn't describe me. In fact, it's only a fitting description for one human being in history and that is Jesus. He is the only person who was truly full of peace and gentleness. The only one without a trace of hypocrisy. And so we each need to be forgiven for and cleansed from the sinful motives which pervade our hearts. And the only way, the only way to do that is by putting our trust in Jesus. And in doing so we humbly acknowledge that his way is the way. His paths are the right ones for us. And so we turn away from the things that might bring us glory, fame, success. And we turn towards him. Following him towards the ways of peace and mercy and goodness and gentleness and self-control. And we still won't do it perfectly. But with the Holy Spirit to help and to guide us we will slowly become wiser. More humble and focus far more on others than on ourselves. And so let me return to that first question. Is it possible to be a peacemaker without being a person of peace? People who understand the need to empty themselves of all of the sinful things which clog up our hearts will be ready vessels to be filled up with the peace that only God can give. And those who have been filled up with God's peace will, without even having to try, be the peacemakers in the world. Jesus testifies to this when he says, Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called children of God.\n\nAnd today's passage ends with these words, A harvest of righteousness is sown in peace for those who make peace. Just imagine in your mind for a moment a field that is full and is ready to be harvested. The crops are ready to be brought in. And the crop of that field is righteousness and goodness. So how did it get there? How did that crop get there? Well it was planted, says James in the Bible, by those who live in peace. And we live in peace when we have complete confidence that God will provide everything that we need. And if we're living like that then we won't feel the need to fight other people for what we need. We can look to Jesus, the one who promises good things for his children and then we can look out and bless others by sowing seeds of goodness and mercy and peace. In a moment we're going to sing again. But if you feel comfortable to do so, I would just like you for a moment or two to close your eyes and picture a landscape filled with fields that are bursting with crops that are ready to harvest. And holding that image in your mind, just hear these words from the second verse of our next hymn. And there's another country I've heard of long ago, most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know. We may not count her armies, we may not see her king, her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering. And soul by soul and silently her shining bounds increase, her ways are ways of gentleness and all her paths are peace. And so my prayer is that each of us will one day be welcomed into that other country as we cross the threshold of death. And then we will be awarded something far greater, far greater than any Nobel Peace Prize. Our reward, friends, will be to hear Jesus say, calling us by name, well done, good and faithful servant. Thank you for following me. Thank you for being a person of peace. Come and celebrate with me forever. Amen. And so if you're able, let's stand together as we sing, I vow to thee my country."

    "transcript": "Thank you very much. On these Sundays, we pause our normal rhythms of singing and of opening the Bible together, and we focus our energy on looking outwards, on serving our neighbours practically, and learning about God's heart for those outside of the church. We've been doing this since the very beginning of Gloucester Vineyard Church, about seven and a half years ago, and it's taken various formats. We've done various different things. Today, we have three different options that we'll be engaging with, which we'll tell you about in a minute. But I just wanted to bring, at the beginning of today, wanted to bring our hearts and our minds to a bit of Bible, to some scripture before we do that kind of unpacks a little bit about why we do this. I've got two little bits. There's a beautiful poem in one of the letters to the early church, which describes what Jesus has done for us, and it says this. Though he, Jesus, was God, he did not think of equality with God as something to cling to. Instead, he gave up his divine privileges. He took the humble position of a slave and was born as a human being. Jesus came to serve. He came to give himself away, to give himself up in preference of others. And when Jesus was speaking with his disciples, he says this in the book of John. He says, this is my commandment, love each other in the same way that I have loved you. There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. You are my friends if you do this what I command. And so we're invited to give up our comfort, to give up our privilege, to give up our individual desires in deference to another. Giving up our life for another is the greatest way that we can show love to the world and engage with Jesus's love for us. And so I invite you today to consider this Super Sunday as a demonstration of love to God and of love to others, to engage with that kind of formational moment that this can be in becoming more like Jesus. So we will be continuing with three things that are going to be happening this afternoon that we will take you through and then we will disperse. So can I have a Bridget, a Daniel, or a Mumbles, Daniel, and a James? Yes. Marvelous. We have three options of what we're going to be doing, which is our practical loving of God and loving of people this week. So have a listen to these. Have a think. Does any of them make you feel, ooh, that's a bit out of my comfort zone? Listen to that and maybe engage with it. Is there anything that you're like, that has stirred something in my heart? I'm like, I love that. Engage with that. So Bridget, what are you doing and where can we meet you? Thank you. So I help to run Grow Baby, which is our free shop for families that are in need in Gloucester. So we are going to be sorting through some things today, organizing Grow Baby with some of the donations that we've had in. You can meet me over there in the church hall. Marvelous. So we've got Grow Baby. Hello. I'm going out with hopefully loads of you to do some litter picking and some praying. And if you don't think that goes together, well, litter picking is just a great thing to do. And for the world we live in, it's a bit of a mess some of the time. And God tells us to be stewards of it. But also he tells us to be servants. And we want to serve our community by picking up the litter. But we can also serve in a spiritual way as well. Well, litter picking might be spiritual as well. But if we encounter people, we can pray for them. We can pray for people's houses and businesses as we walk past them. So all that sort of stuff is really exciting. And we will gather over in the hall in a couple of minutes and give you your high-vis jackets, have a bit of a brief, a bit of a pray, and then go. Crack it. Give them a whoop. Thank you. Daniel, what are you doing today? Okay, so as a church, we are taking kind of 12 months. So the kind of litter picking and sorting out baby clothes is the kind of stuff that we would normally do as a church. At the moment, we're doing something a little bit extra because as a church, we are in a moment of preparation. We're going to be multiplying this church into two expressions in the new year. And so one of the things that we're doing at the moment is we're investing in the community. We're doing some little workshops to just kind of grow in our skills of how to create community, how to be outward focused as a community. And that's what we're going to be doing today. So quick show of hands, who here enjoys food? Yes. Show of hands, who enjoys preparing food? Who likes cooking it? Yes. Now, has anybody who likes cooking food ever found that cooking for more than six or eight people is quite challenging? Anybody ever had that experience? Yes. So I have had that experience. I like preparing food, but I found that when I'm cooking for a larger group of people, it gets monstrously complicated quite quickly. And so what we're going to be doing today is one of the things that we believe as a church is that eating food together, preparing big meals together is one of the most powerful tools we have for creating community. So we're going to be unpacking that thought a little bit, and we're going to be talking about some really helpful little hints and tips and hacks and things that me and my dear mother, Mumbles, have learned over the years. Because Mumbles is a Jedi, and she will be sharing her knowledge with us. And so we're going to be doing a really practical workshop on how can you cook for more than six or eight people and it not be total stress overload, hopefully. How does that sound? So we're going to be in here, and it's going to be very laid back, lots of questions. We're going to talk a lot about food. I'm excited. Yay, can I have a whoop? Absolutely. Wonderful. So we've got three wonderful options for us today. Okay, marvelous. Well, that was a lovely distraction, but hopefully that's... Give me some feedback later. I didn't get as many rolls as I saw them doing on the bake-off, and I thought, that looks really easy. I'll be able to do that. And then I was like, this is the gooeyest thing in the world. How are you supposed to do this? So anyway, thank you for coming. We wanted to do this this afternoon. Actually, when we were thinking about doing these supercharged Sundays, so kind of doing little workshops as well as doing community service like we normally do, this was one of the first ideas that I had. I was like, wouldn't it be great fun to sit down with Mumbles, who, if you guys don't know, this is my mum. We call her Mumbles because she's my mum. She does have another name, which is Helen, but we'll just call her Mumbles. Wouldn't it be fun to sit down with Mumbles and talk to her about food? Because food is a real passion of yours, and you're going to be sharing that with us in a little bit. But it's also a passion for us as a community because of what I just said. We've noticed how eating together is a really powerful force for creating community, and hospitality is really central to the good news of the gospel. And this isn't the kind of thing that Mumbles would normally do because Mumbles is gifted in being in the kitchen, creating beautiful food, and so talking about it is not something that Mumbles would normally do, which is why I'm here. Hello. So I'm here just to be helpful. I hope I'm helpful. But this is really a conversation with Mumbles, but this would be so much more fun if this was a conversation. So let's not be shy. Let's ask lots of questions. Let's share our ideas. Let's just be community. It's wonderful to see you all munching. It just makes me very, very happy. So as I say, this is one of the things that we think is really important. But it's one of the simplest things in the world, isn't it? Sitting around a table and eating together. It's something that we have to do every day, like putting food in our faces is something. We need food for sustenance. But there's something about inviting people over. There's something about cooking a little bit more. There's something about sharing what you have, even if what you have is really simple, with another person that is actually becoming a really rare thing. Where we actually put our phones down, we look at each other's in the eyes, and we share what we have with somebody else. Like when else do we actually do that? And it's our contention that mealtimes are powerful spaces, and that if we're in the business of creating communities, which we are, food should be something, these mealtimes are something that we should be doing. We should be using a lot more often. So Mumbles and I are excited to be doing this today because we have a shared passion for food. We love everything about it. We love preparing it. We love serving it. Maybe not washing up from it so much. But in particular, we both really enjoy the challenge and the joy of feeding large groups of people. And you're probably here because you are the same in some way. You're probably here because you enjoy creating food, or maybe you just like eating and you wanted to talk about food. No judgment here. And like I say, you might well have found, as we found, that when you cook for three or four people, it's fairly simple. Most recipes are designed for that. When you cook for six people or\n\nYou've come home, somebody has made you dinner, and as you open the door the smell just wafts over you and you go, oh yes, what is that food? What is that ultimate comfort food? Who's got one? Who's got one ready and loaded? Rosie? Chicken pie. Oh, chicken pie. What trimmings, please? All of them. All of the trimmings. Every trimmings. What else? Who else has got one? Okay, yes, Chloe, I'm coming to the back. What have you got? Any type of creamy pasta. Oh yes, pasta is life. Ronald? Gourmet steak. Oh, gourmet steak. Anybody else for the old steak? Who's joining for the steak? Benjamin, what have we got? Toad in the hole with mash. Oh, that's a great answer. You guys, what have we got? We'll start with you, Sarah. You'll have a... Fish pie with prawns. Oh, yeah. Lasagna, maybe? Yes. Porker? Sorry? Porker. What's that? A burger? A burger? Oh, come on, sorry, I didn't hear you. Go on, Andrew, have you got one? Chicken wings. Chicken wings, yes, hallelujah. Okay, anybody else? Everybody gets an opportunity. Curry. Curry, yes. Waft of lovely curry. Anybody from this row? Lasagna, it's been said. Roast dinner, yeah. Anybody? Anybody? Yes, go on, boy. Enchiladas. Oh, enchiladas is good. I think mine would be one of Mumble's recipes, which is pork in barbecue sauce, which is a bit of a family recipe. But once you've had it once and you smell it and you're like, oh, yes. Oh, yes. I'm home. What would your answer be? What's your ultimate comfort food? Probably a Thai, beef Thai curry with sticky Thai rice. Delightful, delightful. So, Mumbles, I've said far too much already. Why don't you tell us from your perspective, what is your relationship to food and hospitality and why do you think it's so important? Well, I'll start at the beginning, really. I've always had quite a good understanding that sharing food equals community. And for me, cooking is always from scratch. I was brought up in a village in India and community meals meant things like walking to the church picnic alongside the goat that was destined for the curry. If we wanted English food, we had to make it from scratch because you couldn't just go out and buy it. And one lovely thing that I remember, which I found it really odd because it's obviously different what different people remember, but my dad didn't remember this because he's obviously not interested in food. But at Christmas time, my mum would bake English cakes, loads of English cakes for days and days. And then on Christmas Day, we'd get a stream of villagers coming out from the village and they'd swap what they'd been making for their Christmas. Because essentially, our village was a Christian village, so they celebrated Christmas. And so they'd come out from the village and bring all their sort of delicacies and we'd swap delicacies. And I thought that was a lovely thing. I couldn't believe my dad couldn't remember that. But anyway, so that's sort of where I came from. And coming back to England, we were part of a church where whole church meals were a normal part of church life and sort of bringing share meals and whatnot. And the whole of our married life has revolved around hospitality in one way or another. And apart from feeding Jem, the four kids, although I've had no formal training apart from my hygiene certificates, I've always been involved in catering in the church, doing church functions, weddings, birthday parties. I've worked in a school kitchen, worked as a catering manager at Conference Centre. I've owned a coffee shop and a bed and breakfast. Basically, my whole life has been revolved around hospitality in one way or another. And in the past, when we've run home groups, we've always eaten together regularly. And I really feel that that brings a sort of really good level of community in the home group. And it's one of those things where you lose all your inhibitions with people when you're eating. You lose your, you forget that you're trying to be prim and proper and you forget that you're trying to be, you just be yourself when you're sitting down eating with people, especially if you have a glass of wine with it. Absolutely. For me, feeding people is the way I worship. And so, for instance, when we go away on the weekend away, people would be like, oh, you don't want to be in the kitchen. But yeah, I do want to be in the kitchen because that's the way I worship God. And so that's me. What about you guys? Romans 12, 13 says, always be eager to practice hospitality. So basically, God expects all of us to be hospitable, not just people who have the gifting for it. I mean, I don't have the gifting for this at all. So, you know, I think sometimes we have to step outside of our comfort zones and do things that are not in our gifting. Do you have to have a degree from the Cordon Bleu Cookery School to practice hospitality? No, you don't. To me, hospitality to me is a student with a can of beans and two slices of bread. It's not important what you're eating. It's the company. It's the sharing of lives that's important. At the beginning of our services, we always say we are creating communities. Community to me revolves around food. When you eat together, you relax, you let down your guard, you show yourself with people. And for me, it's one of the best ways of getting to know people. Agreed, right? Yeah. As we were preparing this, we sat down to plan this and we talked for over an hour and a half. And I had to be like, we have to stop this. I have other things that I need to do. Because there was so much that we thought of to say. And one of the things that I just wanted to quickly add to that, I loved how you've said that for you, preparing food is an act of worship. I think that that's really beautiful. And I think that there will be others of us in the room who will resonate with that. And one of the things that occurred to me was like, many of us will have had experiences of experiencing God through our senses. Maybe we go out for a walk in nature. Maybe we walk into a beautiful cathedral and we see something which is beautiful and God speaks to us through that sensual experience. Or maybe we hear a piece of music, a beautiful piece of music. Maybe we see a beautiful piece of artwork or there's something about a sense engaging us and we encounter God in our senses. Why not for food? Why would it be different for food? Why would we think that we wouldn't encounter God's goodness when we eat something delicious, when we smell something delicious, when we prepare something beautiful? I think that's absolutely, totally valid. And I also love what you've said about that thing about eating together being a big social leveler. I think it's one of those things where it can be if we want it to be. I've been very lucky to travel around the world a little bit in my life and I've been to some cultures where how you eat a meal kind of dictates the social standing. And so the most important people will sit down first, they'll be given the best cuts. The least important people will leave the room and wait until the more important people have finished eating. And one of the things that I love about our faith and about Christianity is that we're encouraged to eat together, sat next to one another, that nobody gets a preferential portion, nobody eats before anybody else. We all sit down and we eat together. There is something beautifully, what's the word I'm looking for? Something that dismantles hierarchies. Something very kind of socially leveling about sitting at a table together, each of us, no matter who we are and where we're coming from and eating the same thing as each other. It's beautiful, isn't it? It's quite a powerful statement, I think. And so that's what we're doing today. And so let's get really practical. That's the kind of why. Why do we think food is important? Let's get super, super practical. Mumbles, why don't you just walk us through your process a little bit? Let's say, for example, I've said to you, ah, Mumbles, I have 30 people coming over for a thing. Please, please would you cook some delicious food for it? What is the first thing that you do? Panic. Flip, not another one. Praying is a good place to start. I can't honestly say that it's always my first port of call, but things always run smoother if I do pray first. The trouble is I'm so used to the process now that I begin to rely on my muscle memory, but quite often I can think, well, this isn't gelling. Why isn't this gelling? And I think, well, I haven't actually prayed about it. And God actually cares about that sort of stuff. I'm afraid I'm one of those very annoying people that prays for a parking space because it stresses me out. And God cares about what stresses you out. So pray about what you're doing because he cares. And I know in some ways it's just food, but it isn't just food. Yeah, definitely pray. You're doing it as a service to God. It's not trivial. It's kingdom building. God's gives people gifts and practical skills. I often think of, what's his name, Bezal in Exodus 31, who God filled with the Spirit of God, giving him great wisdom, ability, and skill. God gives us skill. He gives us...\n\nSo whatever skill you've got, God is quite capable of giving you more skill in that area. So whatever skill you've got, God is quite capable of giving you more skill in that area. So whatever skill you've got, God is quite capable of giving you more skill in that area.\n\ndefinitely. So basically I would prep all the vegetables first and then I would probably have them side by side I'm afraid. I don't know whether that's ethical or not. In the separate pans and I would cook them, you know, the meat in one pan and the vegetarian thing in another pan. Obviously a vegetarian dish, if you're doing a lamb something, that's going to take a lot longer to cook than a pumpkin something. So you need to be aware of that, that the vegetarian dish will probably take a lot less time to cook than the meat dish will. But I cook them at the same sort of time. So then you're not making a meat dish, then making a vegetarian dish. It takes absolutely forever. It's cutting some of the stress out by... Yeah. Ronald, do you wanted to add something? Just when you mentioned the meat substitute, are you disendorsing corn? I wouldn't touch it with a barge pole. Mumbles wouldn't touch corn with a barge pole, but it's okay if you would. That's okay if you would. If you do that, you do that. You've got to do you. Yeah. Corn. Corn with a quack. Corn. If you were cooking for lots of people, would you do one dish for everybody or would you say, well, there's 30, so I'll do three different dishes, like one per 10 people? Because when I've cooked for a lot of people, it's hard to know what everyone is actually going to eat. When I cook for my family of five, sometimes I do five different dinners. So do you try and have everyone sitting, eating exactly the same? Or how do you deal with that? I'm afraid I do. But that's just me. I never used to change. I never used to... I'm afraid I was one of those horrible mothers that didn't make lots of different meals for their children. Didn't do me no harm. If they didn't like what I was cooking, they went hungry. So I'm afraid... I suppose I've got that sort of mindset. So although I'm happy to do... I would be happy to do lots of different meals or different... You know, different gluten-free one and a vegetarian one. I probably wouldn't because it always takes me quite a long time to do whatever meal I'm cooking. And I really enjoy doing it. But to do like a beef dish, a chicken dish, I think I would find that quite stressful. Because you and I have a slightly different approach here, which is one of the things I was going to say, which is where you will kind of go, I'm making chicken curry. So I'm going to kind of hoik... Before I put the chicken in, I'm going to sub some pumpkin in and have two very similar curries on the boil at the same time. I would... I find that more stressful. So what I try and do is take everybody's intolerances and allergies and preferences and create one meal that ticks all of the boxes, which can be a lot harder. And obviously the more people that you invite over, the trickier it becomes because the more likely you are to have another kind of... another thing to work around. But yeah, there are a few things that you can make and we'll talk about them a little bit later, which we kind of call one dish to rule them all, which is like, just it's like it's gluten-free, dairy-free, it is vegan, it is pretty simple and everybody seems to like it. And so there's a couple of those which we'll mention later on if that's your thing. Don, you had a question. It was just on that substitute question, because I think you have a non-beef version for mince products. Oh, yes. So Daniel, I think that's probably more Daniel than me, isn't it? When you make a beef chilli. Yes, if I'm going to make a... If I make chilli or bolognese at all now, I don't use beef. Sorry, farmers. I use chickpeas. And so I've found that if you mince up some chickpeas in a food processor and add a bit of... and add some beef stock as well. That makes it non-veg. Oh, no, sorry, that's quite right. Sorry, no. So we're getting to this. The ground up bits of cow, you can't use those. But what you can use, and this is like my favourite hack, is Marmite. Marmite, Marmite, Marmite, Marmite, Marmite. Yeah, you may not... Don't knock until you tried it. Yeah, it's funny actually. If you... You may dislike Marmite on your toast, but if you put a tablespoon full of Marmite in things like macaroni cheese, veggie curries, or veggie anything, it just brings a little umami flavour to everything. So one of the things is that when I'm making a bolognese or a chilli, yes, the Marmite, but I'll also cook it for a really, really long time. So slow cookers, I think, are really, really important because everything then just melts down together. And I have this... So one of my one dish to rule them all is veggie chilli, which has minced up chickpeas in it and some Marmite. And I've served it to people and said, there's something missing from this, what's missing? And a few times people have not been able to tell there's no meat in it. But you do have to cook it for quite a long time until it all becomes a big kind of dark, beautiful conglomeration of flavours. Chloe had a question or a comment. How do you cope when your equipment is at max capacity? Buy more equipment. I was going to say... No more storage in a galley kitchen. Yes, I'm afraid in the past I've sort of thought, right, I need this and bought it. Oh, you could borrow from other people. I mean, you know, if you have that problem, you're always welcome to borrow anything from me. I've got loads of stuff you can borrow. Sometimes. Usually. No, they usually return it. That is one of the challenges I find when cooking for a big group is because when we've gone through the process and you've prayed about who you want to cook for, you know who's coming, my imagination starts to fire and I think, oh, I'll make lasagna or something. And then you go, I don't have any pans that are big enough for lasagna. So at that stage, I think a helpful thing to come in is to kind of go, what can I do? It's like, oh, I would really love to do lasagna for 40, but actually I don't have enough pans, so I might just have to divorce myself from that idea. And so maybe like before the what shall I make thing is like, how can I do something that's going to be low stress? So like a big slow cooker pot of something might be preferable to sheets and sheets and sheets. Like doing pizza for loads of people is a nightmare. Anyone ever tried that? It's a nightmare because most ovens, you're like, you can get four shelves in and it cooks so much slower than you've got four. And then you're like, I've got like 20 hungry teenagers out there. And so like you think pizza, it's so easy. No, it's an absolute nightmare. Oh, well, you could get takeaway pizzas, moneybags, if you like. But I think, you know, that's where community comes in. Have you got a pan that I can borrow? Have you got, and you remember you borrowed my tablecloth that time. So, yeah, just borrow things off people. And I found a steamer works sometimes when you need more hob space. That's a good idea. Yeah. To use it. Sorry, that was use a steamer. Steamers can be very helpful to save some hob space. Are we on to hacks now then? We can be. Who are you calling a hack? Hang on, where do we get to? Yeah, so I just wanted to say a couple of really quick. So we mentioned about one dish to rule them all. Chilli, veggie chilli is one of them because it's rice that goes with it. So that's gluten free. So rice and veggie chilli, that's a good one. And paella, I found is a really, really good one dish to rule them all because you can cook some chorizo if you are, and you can just kind of add it in at the last minute. So that's kind of borrowing Mumbles' technique. But you can make quite a nice veggie paella, which is completely gluten free. And then as Mumbles has said, curry. Like a really beautiful butternut squash curry with some chickpeas, some spinach, maybe a bit of coconut cream in it. Delicious. If you get those spices right, you've gone. Beautiful. It can be like really super simple that everybody can eat. And nobody will notice that there's no meat in it, no gluten in it, no dairy in it. Easy peasy. Yeah, did you want to mention some hacks, Mumbles? Oh, well, only if we've got there. It was just thinking about that. One of my hacks is that, and this is the sort of thing that, this is a chefy thing that they will do in the kitchen. We'll cook the vegetables off first thing in the morning, plunge them in ice water, put them in bowls, the bowls you're going to serve them in, and then just before you serve them, buzz them in the microwave. And that will free up some space on your cooker and whatnot at the last minute. Yeah, that's a good one. So let's talk about some of the challenges that present themselves when we cook for really big groups of people. What do you think are some of the common pitfalls and things that we can easily get wrong if we've not done it before? Boiling water. Oh, hallelujah\n\nwater to come to the boil and to be able to cook the stuff and it just takes ages. That is the classic thing of, I do this at home all the time, it takes me 15 minutes to cook pasta. But if you're making this much pasta, it takes 15 minutes. But if you kind of engage your physics brain and go, I'm using this much water and so then you plunge that much room temperature pasta into it or cold potatoes into it, like the thermal mass of that water just drops into the floor and takes so much more energy to lift that and it just takes such a long time. And also, I mean, if you're used to cooking potatoes, whatever, from cold at home, don't do it for a mass of people. Whatever you're putting in that water, the water needs to be boiling because anything you cook from cold in a big saucepan will just go to mush. Yeah, so that applies for pasta, it applies for potatoes, rice. Yeah. So the tip is get the water like rolling boil and then add the carb in. What else could you do to kind of make that slightly simpler? Because the reality is you also don't want things sitting in boiling water for a really long time. Because they go mushy. Pasta is horrible to cook for a lot of people. And if I was doing that, I would probably cook it in the morning, run cold water over it, get all the starch off it so that it's not sticking together, fridge it if I could, and then just bring it up to temperature. Yeah. I think that's what they do in Italian restaurants actually. I think they cook it off and... Yeah, for the benefit of the recording, that was a very helpful comment about the magic that happens when you cool pasta and then reheat it, the glucose somehow changes. Yeah, rice does that as well I think. Yeah, precisely. There's things about kind of cutting potatoes smaller. So that's the thing I do all the time. I make humongous chunks that take forever to cook. It's just stupid. Cut things smaller, they cook faster. It's things like on Thursday I did what you call pimento potatoes and at home they're so easy. And they take half an hour in the oven. It took over an hour on Thursday because I had a huge tray of them and I had the oven up to... Normally I'd do it on 200 and I think I had the oven up to 240 and it still took ages to cook. So just everything duplicated takes longer, needs a hotter temperature. And there's things like, there's even things like when you're doing those potatoes at home you'd have a baking tray with one layer of potatoes on it. When you're doing them for a big group they're stacked high and so you've got potatoes underneath and you think that's just that won't make any difference at all. It really does. So that means you've got to be taking them out and stirring them more to bring them up to the surface and get them nice and crispy. It's just things like that to think about. It will take longer, you're going to have to stir it. There's also that dynamic has come into play I've found. So when I cook bolognese or chili I cook it for a long time and I expect the water to evaporate off and at home it does quite nicely in it. The sauce reduces and it thickens really beautifully without adding anything. I've tried it for large groups of people and I've got like this enormous reservoir of liquid on the top that's just not going anywhere. The bottom of my pan is burning and on the top I've got this humongous flood with like Noah's Ark on it on the top. So have you ever come across that? Or is that just me? I don't know, you're not stirring it very often. Maybe I'm too lazy and I'm not stirring it enough. Well I have found that. I've got this humongous thing. A couple of things that I've found helps is number one trying to reduce the liquid going in in the first place because I know that might happen. But also just thinking of some different ways of thickening that sauce up rather than trying to wick it away by evaporation which can take ages. Just thickening the sauce with adding things like lentils, adding tomato puree. You said about adding ground almonds to curry. So if you don't have to avoid nut allergies like you said, adding ground almonds to thicken a curry. Bye-bye. That's very delicious. If you're going to touch it then if you're a bit crushed. Perfect custard. I'm terrible at making custard. I usually make like watery scrambled egg. I remember when I was at hospital the staff used to make it in the microwave. They had to get it done quickly. I think custard always burns. In a microwave it's quicker to do it with other people than do milk and sugar. Do it in a fancy way. Yeah. Absolutely. That's a good point actually. I mean making things from scratch is just because I do that just because I'm a bit nutty. But things like that, that's a good hack. Buying, if you've got to do custard, there's nothing wrong with buying a tub of ready-made custard. And things like if you've got to chop lots and lots of onions for whatever you're doing, you can actually buy and things like bolognese sauces, you need, well I don't know how you make yours, but I always use onions, carrots, celery, and you can buy ready frozen sofrito mixes from, I know you can from Sainsbury's, you can definitely buy them from Waitrose, probably from Tesco's. Probably. So if buying something like that doesn't actually cost that much more than buying all of the onions, but you've saved yourself probably an hour's time, all that chopping, and things like frozen shallots, I put shallots in my beef casserole. Peeling shallots is a pain in the neck. Peeling shallots takes absolutely ages and using something like frozen shallots, there's nothing wrong with that. And then they don't, I don't think they taste any worse. So let's just return to carbohydrates really quickly. Talk to us about quantities per person, because that's something I always trip up on, like quantities of rice, pasta, couscous, meat, potatoes, how do you think? Yeah, well I think they're on the scant side, because as you've, I mean I quite often I do too much in the way of carbs, unless it's potatoes, and if you're doing fried potatoes, people will eat a lot more than if you're doing something like mash or new potatoes. So I would say sort of 50 to 75 grams of rice and pasta, potatoes roughly 250 grams, which is like a big, one big potato per person. It's less than you'd think, isn't it? Yeah. Bread, I do one portion per person, because some people won't eat the bread, so the people who won't eat the bread will make up for the people who eat two pieces of bread. Yeah. And what about meat? If you were making a casserole or a curry, how much meat would you factor in per person? Probably about 100 grams, no, 150 grams per person. But then you would put quite a lot of vegetables in with your curries and your stews as well, wouldn't you? Yes, I do put a lot of vegetables in as well. So if it was just, if it was kind of just pure chicken curry, it'd probably be more like 200, 250 grams, wouldn't it? Depending on how generous you were feeling. Probably 200 grams. I think 250 grams is a lot. It's going to be very expensive if you start going to 200 grams. If I'm feeding Ben, it'll be 250 grams. Yes. You're welcome. Yeah. I've noticed something when cooking carbohydrates for large groups of people, and this is anecdotal, so don't, like, this isn't a hill I would die on, but I've noticed that the more people you're cooking for, the less carbohydrates you need per person. So if you're cooking for, so especially when it comes to things like rice and pasta, if you kind of apply that 70 grams per person to everybody, you're just going to end up with so much left over. So the more people I'm cooking for, I'm erring more towards 50 grams per person, because there will be, the people who will eat a kind of standard portion, and then there are people who will have a mousy little portion, and I'll think, I've cooked the wrong thing. Why are you eating so little? But that's just the amount of rice that they want. So there's two exceptions. So yeah, for me, rule of thumb is the more people you're cooking for, the less carbohydrates you need per head. The two exceptions to that are, number one, if you're creating delicious carbohydrates, they will go. So fried potatoes, focaccia bread, if you've made a delicious fatty carbohydrate, yeah, they are all going. The other exception is if you're feeding Africans or Indians, because people from Africa and India really like eating rice. And so, like, you know, just so much rice, and you're like, this is a pleasure. So much rice. So if you're feeding folks from other parts of the world, they may have a higher appetite for rice. Yeah, Steve. You mentioned demographics for carbs and stuff like that. What about age groups and things like that? Do you look at the demographic of who you're feeding and then look at portions based on that? Yeah, that's a good question. I had one daughter get married one year, and she got married in her 30s, and all of her friends were in her 30s, and I did far too much food, and there was loads left over. The next year...\n\nMy daughter, who was, how old was she, mid-twenties, I suppose? No, she wasn't, she was younger than that. She was 20, I think. 22? She was a lot younger. So her and her husband and all of their friends were at the lower end of the spectrum. 20s, yeah, 20. In their early 20s. And I did think about that and I thought, right, okay, well I'll do a little bit more food than I did for Hannah's wedding. And it all went. It was like the vultures had come in. Yes. So yeah, actually age does matter. I mean, if you were cooking for a lot of people my age and upwards, you probably wouldn't do nearly as much as if you were cooking for people in their 20s or even in their teens. What about kiddos, if you've got kids coming as well? It depends on the kids, really. Yeah, I mean, I think kids probably half portions I would do. That's generally what I would do, yeah. Unless it's you, in which case it's a double portion. When you cook a large meal, everyone is eating, there's always somebody come up, you've got any more, can I have some more? What happens if you're going to have to... Yes. Well, they just have to get... I mean, if I'm working over there, I haven't got anything else to give them, I guess. It is an interesting feeling, isn't it, when you've cooked something for a large group and it all goes. Yes. You kind of go, well, I'm delighted that it's all gone. But at the same time, did I make enough? Should I have made more? Yeah. It's tricky, it's tricky. Okay, let's talk about food hygiene. Ha-ha, everyone's favorite subject. What are the risks when cooking for a large number? What foods would you consider high risk and what should we be careful of? Probably worth just mentioning things that are just generally true, but what is particularly high risk with large numbers? Right, so generally, a high risk food, what they would call a high risk food, is a protein food that is ready to eat. So, ham, cooked chicken, cooked ham, cooked chicken, cheese, cream, that sort of thing, but also hummus, rice, beans, lentils are high risk foods because they are full of protein and the more times you heat them up, cool them down, heat them up, cool them down, the more chance there is of bacteria growing in them and feeding off the proteins in the, particularly pulses, are surprisingly high risk foods. So, yeah, hummus, that's a surprising one, right? Chickpeas, yeah. Chickpeas are very high risk because they're full of protein. So, what's the kind of golden rule when it comes to playing it safe, not poisoning people and killing people, which would be nice? I think if you're going to do it on a regular basis, you really need to either consider getting at least a level one hygiene certificate, at the very base. Have you got a food policy? No, I don't. So, the very, we have got a food policy as GVC, so the very least thing you should do if you're thinking of doing it regularly is to read the GVC food policy, but consider getting at least a level one food hygiene certificate, which is very easy to do online or read up on it online. It just gives you things like temperatures, things like keeping things cold below five degrees and taking things from five degrees to over 60 degrees within a very short space of time because between five degrees and 60 degrees is a very high risk. That's the danger zone, isn't it? Danger zone. Yeah. So, it's kind of things being warm. Yeah. That's the danger. Warm things. And things like, if you've made, there's nothing wrong with making a chili or a bolognese the day before, but if you do that, you need to cool it down very quickly. One of the easiest ways to do that is either to portion it out and cool it down or to fill the sink up with ice water and put the pan in that, cool it down, and then it must be kept in a fridge or, yeah, in a fridge, basically. If anybody wants to get a level one food certificate, just come and talk to me. We will pay for you to get one because they're cheap as chips and we'd be very happy to send you on a level one. It's e-learning, so it's a couple of hours, but we'd be very happy to pay for that. So, come and talk to me and I can hook you up. Anything else you want to say about food hygiene before we start to kind of wrap things up? I think that was it. Okay. So, we just want to wrap it up with just a few simple hacks, little tips and tricks, things that we found helpful. We've mentioned a few of these already. We talked about ready-chopped frozen veg in a bag is your friend. Peeled shallots. One of mine is use a food processor. That's what it's there for. Just chop things really quickly, chuck it in there, chop it up. Easy peasy. And one of those like soupy blender things. Those things are great. That's it. Brilliant. Pastry. You're talking about, I've just got the word pastry here. What does that mean? I don't know. I thought that. What do you mean by pastry? Maybe we should ignore that. I think, yeah. I mean, if you're doing pastry, for goodness sake, don't make puff pastry. No. I'm saying avoid pastry or try pastry. Well, if you really want to make a pie, go for it. It's your funeral. It's the kind of thing that you would do if you were feeding a large group of people. You might make some savoury tarts or some quiches, as we say in church. Yeah. I mean, I would probably make, if it was shortcrust, I'd probably make it because I find that easy. But I would say, if you don't like making pastry, buy it because it's not that expensive and it's very good. There's nothing wrong with it. So if you... I definitely wouldn't make flaky or puff pastry. No, you're not mad. Not if I was doing it for a lot of people. No, you might do it for fun, but maybe not. Yeah, I might do it for fun sometime, but not. That's it. Brilliant. Pastry. You're talking about... I've just got the word pastry here. What does that mean? I don't know. I thought that. What do you mean by pastry? Maybe we should ignore that. I think, yeah. I mean, if you're doing pastry, for goodness sake, don't make puff pastry. No. I'm saying avoid pastry or try pastry.

But I would say, if you don't like making pastry, buy it because it's not that expensive and it's very good. There's nothing\n\nI always said, it's not about the food, it's about having people come over and being together. And so to be able to say to someone, we're just having, we're not having a dinner party, we're having what we would normally eat. It'll be simple, you know, and setting expectations. And then everybody goes, oh, okay. And if someone says, can I bring something? Go, yes, please. Bring that. Buy a pudding and bring it. Like, then you're setting expectations. Either you buy a pudding or I'll buy a pudding. Great. But, you know, if you want to bring a pudding, whatever. So setting expectations and then, yeah, just saying, this is nothing fancy. This is so we can enjoy time. I think that is, do you want to say something about that? Nope, that's fine. Yeah, I 110% agree with that. And I think that what Diane said there actually applies across the board of how we think about what we do as a church. Whilst, yes, we want to do things in a way that is excellent because we want people to encounter a God who is excellent and generous. At the same time, we're trying to create community. And so what we don't want to do is say, if you're going to feed people, it has to look like this. It has to look like that, blah, blah, blah. If you think about inviting the people from your neighborhood over, and when they come over to your house, you've prepared a three-course meal which has cost you £65 to make and your house is spotlessly clean and you're wearing a tuxedo. Then if they're going to want to reciprocate and say, with a very polite British thing of, why don't you come over to my house? Then the message is, I need to spend £65 on a meal and wear a tuxedo and hoover my house. And so this is no joke. If you've ever been around to our house before, you will have noticed it's quite messy in our house. And that's because we have children. And so we might hoover before you come over, but that'll probably be it. And that's on purpose because we want you to come into our home and go, ah, it's kind of messy in here. I can relax because it's not neat as two pins. And if I come over to your house, I'm like, I want it to be a totally low bar for you to be like, yeah, whatevs, I don't have to perform. That's creating community because it's lowering the bar, isn't it? And it's kind of, everybody's on the same page. Thank you, Diane. I really appreciate what you said there. Anybody else want to add something? Yeah. I want to ask Mumbles what her opinion is of reheating batch cooked meals for lunch in microwaves. Batch cooked? Well, as long as they've been kept cold. I mean, when you say batch cooked, have they been in the freezer or in the fridge? Batch cooked something, put extra in the freezer. Well, I defrost it in the fridge or just cook it straight from the freezer. Don't leave it out on a work surface. Although I have to say I occasionally do. Basically, make sure it comes up to a really hot temperature. And a good way of doing that is to stick a knife in the center of it. If you haven't got a thermometer, stick a knife in the center of it and put it on the inside of your lip. And if it's really hot, then you know that it's hot enough. Put it on your wrist. Use this part of your wrist and if it burns a bit, then it's hot enough. Yes, just make sure that whatever you're bringing it back up to temperature, that you bring it properly back up to temperature. Yeah, I just wanted to share a bit similar to Diane really. I was working in Cheltenham years ago with some Spaniards. And they used to get to the end of the month and they'd say, oh, Tarna, we have no money. You are welcome to our house, but we will have potatoes and carrots. And I used to go to their house at the end of the month and have the most delicious potatoes and carrots. I don't know what they did with them, but they were amazing. But more than that, it was the being together and the sharing the time together. It was just so precious. Absolutely. Yes. Can I just say something from being on the receiving end of hospitality? Because, I mean, for us, we don't want the people providing the hospitality to be stressed about what they're doing for us. I mean, that will make us feel awkward. So please, when you're providing for other people, don't put yourself in a stressful position because it's not going to bless you and it's not going to bless the people you're trying to bless. And I can tell you from our angle, we don't care what we receive. We're just grateful that people have opened their homes and been kind and loving enough to give us some food. We literally don't care what it is. The important bit is that people have opened their homes and been loving towards us. What it is doesn't matter. Beans on toast is good, especially if it's got poached egg with it. I feel like you slightly undercut your point there by adding the poached egg bit at the end. As long as it's got a lovely hollandaise sauce on the side, that's fine. Great. Should we pray, guys, and then should we go over? Father God, we thank you. We thank you for your love for each of us. We thank you for your heart for hospitality. And Lord, we thank you for Mumbles. And we thank you for people like Mumbles who think in terms of food, who want to express their worship and their creativity through food, who want to bless people and serve people with meals and with hospitality. Lord, we pray that you would be forming us into a church who understands how to create community in all sorts of ways, and particularly a church who is generous with our homes, with our dinner tables, with the food that we eat and the time that we share. Lord, we ask you to come and form us and help us. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you, guys. Thanks for coming along. Can we give Mumbles a massive round of applause? That was really fun. Thank you."

    "transcript": "The gospel reading comes from John chapter 12 beginning at verse 20. Now among those who went to worship at the festival were some Greeks. They came to Philip who was from Bethsaida in Galilee and said to him, Sir, we wish to see Jesus. Philip went and told Andrew. Then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. Jesus answered them, The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Very truly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain. But if it dies, it bears much fruit. Those who love their life lose it and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me and where I am, there will my servant be also. Whoever serves me, the Father will honor. Now my soul is troubled and what should I say? Father, save me from this hour? No, it is for this reason that I have come to this hour. Father, glorify your name. Then a voice came from heaven. I have glorified it and I will glorify it again. The crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder. Others said, An angel has spoken to him. Jesus answered, This voice has come for your sake, not mine. Now is the judgment of this world. Now the ruler of this world will be driven out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself. He said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die. The crowd answered him, We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man? Jesus said to them, The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness, you do not know where you're going. While you have the light, believe in the light so that you may become children of light. After Jesus had said this, he departed and hid from them. This is the gospel of the Lord. Praise to you, O Christ. Good morning. Do take a seat. Great to be with you. If you've not met me before, my name's Gemma. I'm the vicar. It's always a privilege to be preaching, and particularly so as part of this series in the book of Ruth. And I'd really encourage you to have that chapter open in front of you. It's page 269, I think, in the church Bibles. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we thank you that we can hold your word in our hands and hear it with our ears and in our hearts. And I pray that your word would change us and renew us this morning. In Jesus' name. Amen. Well, at Explore at Four, our afternoon service this term, we've been looking at women of faith in the Bible. And a few weeks ago, we were exploring this very story, the story of Ruth. And when I was planning the service, I was pondering how best to present the events that we've heard today from chapter 3. And it reminded me that there are a great many chapters in the Bible that are not exactly family-friendly. But by way of a recap, if you haven't been journeying with Ruth and us over the last couple of weeks, we've journeyed with Ruth and her mother-in-law Naomi from Ruth's homeland in Moab back to Naomi's home in Bethlehem. And they were doing that to escape the ravages of famine in Moab. And these two women have shown an extraordinary commitment to each other. It's been forged out of the sadness of their shared bereavement. And on arriving in Bethlehem, Naomi's hometown, they've been looked after by a prominent landowner named Boaz. And he has shown himself to be a devoted follower of the Lord, faithful in following the Israelite laws, and in particular, those laws that ensure that foreigners in the land are provided for. And not only has Ruth been allowed to glean, to gather grain in Boaz's field, he's blessed her with an abundance of grain. And that's freed her and Naomi from the daily pressure of having to search for food. And Boaz in chapter 2 has been described as a man of noble character. And the Hebrew word for noble here is charlie. And we see this in the way that he has generously welcomed and blessed Ruth, simply because of these laws that governed how they lived and because of her family connections with his relative Naomi. And in chapter 2, we see Boaz praying. We hear him praising Ruth. We hear him protecting her and even changing the way that the work was done in his field to ensure the best outcomes for her. And when you think about it, that is really astonishing, given that Ruth turns up unannounced and was at the absolute bottom of the societal pecking order. Recently, I was watching a panorama documentary and it was following several families in the UK whose children weren't able to go to school because of the various additional needs that they had, which weren't being accommodated for in mainstream educational settings. And the parents who were interviewed were at their wits' end and were struggling to come to terms with the fact that their child couldn't be educated because there wasn't enough places in schools that could meet their additional needs. And they felt really stuck and let down by those who had the power to make a difference. And that documentary concluded at the end that the system of education in our country was failing a great many children who needed a different type of schooling provision. It was acknowledged that the system is broken. And I'm sure we have used that phrase in other conversations as well, thinking perhaps about the NHS or other institutions in our land. We live within a great many broken systems. And Ruth and Naomi are stuck within a broken system as well. Boaz's generosity meant that these women had enough to eat for the time being. But what would happen to them when the harvest was over? Widows had virtually no long-term security and with Ruth remaining unmarried, there was no one to carry on the family name of her father-in-law Elimelech. And it's important to remember that the patriarchal society that Ruth was born into was not how God intended it to be. Yes, Boaz acts honorably when he seeks to ensure that the male workers in his field leave Ruth alone and don't molest her. That's in chapter 2. But clearly it is not okay that that kind of abuse against women was commonplace. And I strongly believe that in the beginning God's creation plan was for men and women to be equal and for everyone to be loved and cherished by everyone else. Human sin has caused every person and every society since then to fall very far short of God's ideal. And it is true that Ruth goes to some extreme lengths urged on by Naomi to forge a way out of that broken system to create options for themselves where there appears to be none. But just in case we're tempted to judge these women for their actions, let's remember that even today vulnerable, oppressed, systematically disadvantaged women across the world\n\nlittle other option but to turn to crime or prostitution when seeking a way out of life-threatening poverty. Desperate times may well require desperate measures, and desperate measures usually come with dangerous risks. And so chapter 3 that we've heard today could be described as the three plans. First there's Naomi's plan, then there's Ruth's plan, and then there's Boaz's plan. So Naomi seems to have decided that Boaz would make a good husband for Ruth. And she gives these bold instructions to her daughter-in-law. Ruth is to go to the threshing floor, a secluded place outside of the town, which was associated with sexual immorality and prostitution. She's to dress well. She's to wear perfume. And Naomi says, Ruth, wait until Boaz is asleep and then quite literally lie in wait for him at his feet in the place that would normally be reserved for the man's wife. The signal is clear. Ruth is to communicate to Boaz, I would like to be your wife. And the way that the passage is written seems to highlight that there was a very real opportunity for immorality. Not only the location of where this was happening, but also the reference to them lying together and the mention of Boaz's feet uncovered by Ruth. That word there in Hebrew could also refer to a different part of Boaz's anatomy. Here is a man and a woman alone at night. The chances for a sexual encounter were high, which makes it all the more surprising and wonderful that Boaz and Ruth are chaste and honourable in their actions. Ruth was making a culturally understood non-verbal request for protection and for marriage. It was bold. It was risky. And Ruth did it. So Ruth has followed Naomi's plan, but she's also added a strategy of her own. She remembers that Naomi has mentioned that Boaz is a kinsman redeemer of Elimelech, Naomi's husband who died. Kinsman redeemer was a male relative who had the responsibility and the right to act on behalf of a relative who was in trouble, in danger or in need. They had a few basic duties, including these two. If a relative became so poor that they had to sell themselves as slaves, then the kinsman redeemer was responsible for purchasing their freedom. And then secondly, if a married man died without having children, as was the case here, the kinsman redeemer could be required to marry the widow. And then any children from that marriage would be legally considered heirs of the deceased husband, ensuring that the deceased man's family line and property rights continued. And so that practice was helped to preserve the deceased man's name and his legacy within the community. So you can sense a bit of hope here in the story of Ruth. But there were some problems as well. In Ruth's case, two things made this situation unusual. Firstly, Boaz wasn't a brother of the man who had died. He wasn't Elimelech's brother. He was more of a distant relative. So it wasn't clear if he had the same obligations as a brother would have had. And secondly, Ruth was a foreigner. She was from Moab. And the laws about kinsman redeemers didn't specifically say anything about what to do with foreign widows. So when Ruth says to the just woken up, startled Boaz, I am your servant Ruth, spread the corner of your garment over me since you are a kinsman redeemer of our family. What she's really saying is, will you buy the land of Naomi's husband Elimelech? Will you marry Ruth? And will you give Naomi an heir? Ensuring that both Ruth and Naomi are protected and provided for indefinitely. It is a bit complicated. But this is an escape the system kind of plan. But it's a risky strategy because she doesn't know how Boaz is going to react. And so what happens next is nothing short of astonishing. Boaz seems to instantly recognize something about Ruth's character. That she is willing to marry him for Naomi's sake, not for her own sake. And Boaz is overwhelmed by Ruth's selflessness and he agrees to her plan. Imagine being Ruth and hearing Boaz say these words. May you be blessed by the Lord my daughter. You have made this last kindness greater than the first. In that you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich. And now my daughter do not fear. I will do all that you ask. For all my fellow townsmen know that you are a noble woman. And there is that word again, Charlie. Boaz, the Charlie, the noble man now names Ruth, Charlie. Noble woman. And in a short time Ruth has gone from being this outsider, this alien from Moab who had nothing. To being a respected noble woman in Bethlehem and the potential future wife of Boaz. And so things looked promising but there was one further complication. Boaz knows of someone who is an even closer relative. And he had the right of first refusal. So Boaz says I'm going to look into all of this in the morning. But for now Ruth I'm going to send you home with six measures of grain. That's a lot. Significant that it's six measures. Seven in the Old Testament particularly is the number of completeness. Six is incomplete. She is almost there but not quite. There's a promise that the story isn't over. And at the end of Ruth chapter 3, and I'm so tempted to carry on and preach into chapter 4 but I'm not going to. We're still waiting to see what happens. And it is such a wonderful story and like many stories it works on more than one level. Because it is a story about Ruth and Boaz but it's also a story about you and I. Ruth is the ultimate outsider. A widow, a foreigner, a destitute woman in ancient Israel. Without money, status or protection she's vulnerable to abuse. She'd have no legal recourse. Her circumstances could hardly have been worse. But in this deeper metaphor Ruth is every single one of us. We are all helplessly trapped in the broken system of sin. This is a problem that we cannot solve on our own. We need a redeemer. And in this deeper story enters Jesus. The one who will be born into many generations later. The family tree of Boaz and Ruth. To be a kinsman redeemer you needed two things. You needed to be related and you needed to be willing. By taking on human flesh Jesus becomes our brother. Close enough to redeem us and yet perfect enough to pay the full price for our salvation. And he willingly offers his life to redeem all who will trust in him. So Boaz is this herald of Christ's compassion and generosity. And just as Boaz extended kindness and protection to Ruth\n\nyouth, this foreign outcast, Jesus offers his grace to all of us who are spiritually helpless. And so the book of Ruth isn't just a love story between two people, it's a picture of the greatest love story that has ever been told, the love of God for his children. And that love took him much further than a grain pile at midnight. It caused Jesus to leave the glories of heaven and come as a baby to Bethlehem where he found no refuge. Unlike for Ruth, there was no place of rest for Jesus in Bethlehem, no godly Boaz to protect him. He had to make do with a temporary place in a stable before he was driven out having to flee for his life, even as a baby. And yet the love that is God and is within God caused Jesus to abandon that eternal glory and become a servant, someone who was of no reputation. He was despised, he was rejected by those who would eventually nail him to a cross. And there in the midst of a darkness far deeper than any ordinary midnight, he offered himself up for the sins of his people. And through his ultimate sacrifice, he offers us his name. And he declares that everyone who trusts in him shall be called, as we heard in that John passage, children of God. Where do we go from here? At the end of Ruth chapter 3, we turn to God in praise and thankfulness for all that Jesus has done for us. If we have accepted him in our hearts, we are called children of God. And if we haven't yet done that, then today is a great opportunity to do it. And then we turn to the world and we ask God to give us eyes of compassion and Charlie noble hearts that we might be like those who, like Boaz, go out of our way for the stranger in our midst. And those who, like Naomi and Ruth, act with courage and determination to find another way, even in the face of systems which have been broken by human sin. Wherever we go from here, we need to be brave. But whatever we do, it will be worth it. Nikki's going to lead us in prayer now."

    "transcript": "The Old Testament reading is taken from the book of Ruth, chapter 3, verses 1 to 18, which can be found on page 269 of the Old Testament part of the Church Bibles. Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her, My daughter, I need to seek some security for you, so that it may be well with you. Now here is our kinsman, Boaz, with whose young women you have been working. See, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor. Now wash and anoint yourself, and put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor. But do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. When he lies down, observe the place where he lies. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down, and he will tell you what to do. She said to her, All that you say, I will do. So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had instructed her. When Boaz had eaten and drunk and was in a contented mood, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came stealthily and uncovered his feet and lay down. At midnight the man was startled and turned over. And there lying at his feet was a woman. He said, Who are you? And she answered, I am Ruth, your servant. Spread your cloak over your servant, for you are next of kin. He said, May you be blessed by the Lord, my daughter. This last instance of your loyalty is better than the first. You have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich. And now, my daughter, do not be afraid. I will do for you all that you ask. For all the assembly of my people know that you are a worthy woman. But now, though it is true that I am a near kinsman, there is another kinsman more closely related than I. Remain this night, and in the morning, if you will act as next of kin for you, good, let him do it. But if he is not willing to act as next of kin for you, then, as the Lord lives, I will act as next of kin for you. Lie down until the morning. So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before one person could recognize another, for he said, It must not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor. Then he said, Bring the cloak you are wearing and hold it out. So she held it, and he measured out six measures of barley and put it on her back. Then he went into the town. She came to her mother-in-law, who said, How did things go with you, my daughter? Then she told her all that the man had done for her, saying, He gave me these six measures of barley, for he said, Do not go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed. She replied, Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out, for the man will not rest, but will settle the matter today. This is the word of the Lord. Thank you, Lucy. Good morning. Great to be together. It is on, Brian. So, yeah. It is on, Brian. OK. OK. Brilliant. OK. Apologies. It wasn't on at my end. It is on now. We're good. We're good. Good morning. It's great to be together. If I've not met you before, my name's Gemma. I'm the vicar here, and it's always such a privilege to be able to open God's word together and explore it. So I really encourage you to have the Bibles open. Page 269. We'll be referring back a little bit to chapter 2 as well. So hopefully you've got a Bible nearby. Let's pray. Lord God, we thank you so much for your word. Thank you that we can hold it in our hands and that you speak to us through it and you speak into our hearts and shape our characters and our actions. And so I pray that you would be speaking to us today and that we would be ready to hear from you and to act on what we hear. Amen. If you're here and haven't been here for the last couple of weeks or listening to this and haven't heard the other two sermons about the book of Ruth, I'd really encourage you to go back and listen to them through our website. I am going to kind of recap a little bit as to kind of where we've got to because we're very much like diving in in the middle of this story. And this is the kind of, this is the really meaty bit of Ruth, the story of Ruth. And a couple of weeks ago at Explorer 4, our afternoon service, we were exploring this story because we're doing a series at the moment on women of faith. And I was a bit sad that we had to kind of slightly gloss over the events that happen in chapter 3. They're quite complicated. They're not massively kind of family friendly. And so we sort of jumped from Boaz let Ruth glean in his field to, and then Boaz and Ruth were married. But chapter 3 sits in the middle of those two important events. And we're going to really kind of dig into that today. So by way of a recap, we have journeyed with Ruth and her mother-in-law, Naomi, from Ruth's homeland, which was Moab, the other side of the Jordan River, back to Naomi's home of Bethlehem. And they were escaping the famine in Moab. And these two women have shown an extraordinary commitment to each other. It's been forged out of the sadness of their bereavement. Both have lost their husbands. And on arriving in Bethlehem, they've been looked after by this prominent landowner called Boaz. He has shown himself to be devoted to the Lord, faithful in following the Israelite laws. And he ensures that foreigners are provided for. And the way that he does that is he lets Ruth glean in his field and blesses her with an abundance of grain. And that frees Ruth and Naomi from the daily pressure of having to search for food. And Boaz has been described in chapter 2 as a man of noble character. And in Hebrew, the word for this is chali, C-H-A-L-I. And we see this in the way that he has generously welcomed and blessed Ruth in keeping with the Israelite laws, but also because of her connections with Naomi, who is one of his relatives. And in chapter 2, we observed Boaz praying. He's a man of prayer. He praises Ruth. He has good things to say about her. He protects her and even changes the way that the work was done in his field in order to ensure the best outcomes for her. And when you think about it, that is so astonishing, isn't it? That she turns up unannounced. She's at the absolute bottom of the societal pecking order. And here is Boaz going out of his way to help her. Don't know whether you ever watch Panorama, the documentaries. They obviously cover a whole range of things. I was watching Panorama quite recently, and it was focusing on several families in the UK whose children were not able to go to school because of different emotional and physical needs that they had, which meant that they just weren't coping in mainstream school. And the parents who were interviewed were just at their absolute wits' end. They were really struggling to come to terms with the fact that kind of their child was being left out of education because there just weren't enough places in schools that could provide those sorts of things that their children needed. And they felt really stuck and let down by...\n\nthose who had the power to make a difference. And basically, the conclusion at the end of the documentary was that the education system is broken. And that is probably not news to very many people. And we know that there are a great many other systems within our land and within our world that are also broken. That are meaning that they're not able to provide what they're supposed to be providing because the system itself has gone wrong. And Ruth and Naomi are stuck within a broken system. It's a system that meant that women were at the bottom of the pile, and particularly those whose husbands had died or left them. Boaz's generosity meant that Ruth and Naomi had enough to eat for the time being. But what would happen to them when the harvest was over? Widows had no long-term security. And if Ruth remained unmarried, then there was also no one to carry on the family name and protect the land of Elimelech, who was Naomi's husband who died. So there is something very broken about the system that exists within this story. And part of that brokenness is the patriarchy. And it's just important, I think, to note that patriarchal society, which obviously is a really strong theme throughout history, and we see it particularly in the Bible, and particularly in the Old Testament, that is not how God intended society to be, I don't think. Boaz does act honorably when he seeks to ensure, and we see this in chapter 2, that the male workers in his field leave Ruth alone and don't molest her. But clearly it's not okay that that kind of abuse against women was commonplace, that he was having to kind of call it out and say, actually, don't do that. I believe so strongly that God's plan from the beginning was that men and women would be equal and that everyone would be loved and cherished by everyone else. And human sin is what has caused every person and every society since then to fall very far short of God's ideal. And what we will see as we kind of dig in a bit more to chapter 3 is that Ruth and Naomi do go to extreme lengths to forge a way out of that broken system and to create options for themselves where there appears to be none. And we might be tempted to judge them for that. Oh, here are kind of two sort of women trying to like wield their power and kind of trick Boaz into marrying Ruth. But I think we need to remember that even today, vulnerable, oppressed, systematically disadvantaged women across the world have little other option but to turn to desperate measures, perhaps crime, maybe prostitution, to seek a way out of life-threatening poverty. Desperate times may require desperate measures, but desperate measures usually come with dangerous risks. And what Ruth did at the threshing floor was a dangerous risk. That's why we've called today's chapter Loving Through Risk. We might also have called it the chapter of the three plans, because first we hear Naomi's plan, then we get kind of Ruth's interpretation and enactment of that plan, and then finally we hear Boaz's plan. So Naomi has concluded that Boaz would make a good husband for Ruth. And so she gives these bold instructions to her daughter-in-law. Ruth is to go to the threshing floor, a secluded place outside of the town where they threshed the grain that had been gathered in. A place associated in that culture with sexual immorality, with prostitution. Ruth is to dress well, she's to wash and to wear perfume. And Naomi says to Ruth, wait until Boaz is asleep, and then quite literally lie in wait for him, at his feet, in the place that would normally have been reserved for the man's wife. The signal that Ruth is to communicate to Boaz is clear. I would like to be your wife. That's what she's communicating through what she does. And the way that the passage is written, and we don't know who wrote Ruth, but whoever wrote it seems to be highlighting that there was a very real opportunity, note that word, for immorality. Not only the location, this all happened at the threshing floor, also the reference to them lying together, we kind of get the sort of euphemism of that. The reference to Boaz's feet that were uncovered by Ruth, the word feet here in Hebrew could also be used for a different part of Boaz's anatomy. Here we have a man and a woman alone at night. The chances for a sexual encounter were high. And that makes it all the more surprising and wonderful that Boaz and Ruth are chaste and honourable in their actions. What Ruth was doing was not trying to seduce him, but to make a culturally understood non-verbal request for protection and for marriage. It was really bold. It was very risky. But Ruth did it. And so she follows Naomi's plan, but she adds a strategy of her own. Naomi's mentioned that Boaz is a kinsman redeemer of Elimelech's, Naomi's husband who had died. Just hopefully do this quick deep dive into what a kinsman redeemer is. If it feels a bit much, just zone out for the next minute. A male relative who had the responsibility and indeed the right to act on behalf of another relative who was in trouble, in danger or in need. And their basic duties were that if a relative became so poor that they had to sell themselves into slavery, the kinsman redeemer was the one that was responsible for purchasing their freedom. And the second responsibility was that if a married man like Elimelech died without having any children, as Elimelech did have children, but the kinsman redeemer could be required to marry the widow. Any children from that marriage would legally be considered heirs of the deceased husband, ensuring that his family line and property rights continued. And so that practice helped to ensure that if a man had died without any children, his name and his legacy within the community could continue. Hopefully if you've sort of followed that, you can sense that there is now some hope. But there were some problems as well. Because in Ruth's case, two things made this situation really unusual. So firstly, Boaz wasn't a brother of the man who had died. He was a more distant relative. And so it wasn't clear if he had the same obligations as a brother would have. And secondly, Ruth is a foreigner. Naomi's not, but Ruth has married Naomi's son and Ruth is a foreigner. And now Ruth's husband has died as well, leaving them without any children. And the laws about kinsman redeemers didn't specifically say anything about what to do with foreign widows. So when Ruth says to Boaz, who has just woken up and is startled, I am your servant, Ruth. Spread the corner of your garment over me since you are a kinsman redeemer of our family. What she's really saying, if we translate kind of in a way that code, is Boaz, will you buy the land that was owned, the land near Bethlehem that was owned by my mother-in-law Naomi's husband, Elimelech. Will you then marry me, Ruth, so that I hopefully can give Naomi and Elimelech an heir?\n\ngive them a grandson, which would then ensure that both Ruth and Naomi were provided for indefinitely. It's an escape the system kind of plan, but it is a very risky strategy because she doesn't know how Boaz is going to react. And so what happens next is nothing short of astonishing. Boaz seems to instantly kind of see something about Ruth's character. It's like he looks into her heart and sees that what Ruth is doing in asking to marry Boaz is as much for Naomi's sake as it is for her own gain. And Boaz is overwhelmed by Ruth's selflessness, and so he agrees to her plan, to her request. Imagine how Ruth would have felt hearing Boaz say, this is verses 10 to 11, may you be blessed by the Lord, my daughter. You have made this last kindness greater than the first in that you've not gone after young men, whether poor or rich. And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do all that you ask, for all my fellow townsmen know that you are a noble woman. And there is that word again, charlie in Hebrew. Boaz, the charlie, the noble man, now names Ruth charlie, noble woman. And so in this really short time, Ruth has gone from being this moor about outsider with nothing to a respected woman in Bethlehem, and the possible future wife of Boaz. So things are looking really promising, but there was one more complication. Boaz knows of someone who is an even closer relative to Elimelech, who has the right of first refusal. And so Boaz says, I'm going to look into all this in the morning, but for now, Ruth, you can go home quietly before anyone sees you. Take these six measures of grain. That was a lot, probably about 80 pounds. Probably very significant that it was six measures. Seven in the Bible is the number of completeness. Six is incomplete. Ruth is almost there. They've almost got their plan over the line, but not quite. There is a promise, but the story isn't over. And at the end of Ruth chapter 3, we are still waiting to find out what happens. And I'm so tempted to carry on and preach into chapter 4, but that wouldn't be fair because we're going to do that in two weeks' time. It is a wonderful story. And like many stories, perhaps all stories, it works on more than one level because it is a story about Ruth and Boaz and their family. But it is also a story about you and me. Because Ruth is the archetypal outsider. She's a widow. She's a foreigner. She's a destitute woman in ancient Israel. She has no money, no status, no protection. She was vulnerable to abuse and she would have had no legal recourse if that had happened. Her circumstances could not have been worse. And in this deeper metaphor, Ruth is every single one of us. We are all helplessly trapped in the broken system of sin and escaping from it is a problem that we can't solve on our own. And every single one of us needs a redeemer. And so into this story, quite a few generations later, but in the line, the family tree of Boaz and Ruth, enters Jesus as a baby in Bethlehem. To be a kinsman redeemer, you needed two things. You needed to be related and you needed to be willing. And by taking on human flesh, God becomes our brother, our friend, like us, close enough to redeem us and yet perfect enough to pay the full price for our salvation. And he is willing. He's willing to offer his life to redeem, to buy back, buy out of that broken system, all who trust in him. And so Boaz in this story is a herald, a signpost to the compassion and the generosity of Jesus. And just as he's extending kindness and protection to Ruth, a foreign outcast, Jesus hangs on the cross extending grace to all who are spiritually helpless. And so the book of Ruth isn't just a love story between Ruth and Boaz, although it is that. It's a picture of the greatest love story that the world has ever known, the love of God for his children. A love that caused him to go much further than a threshing floor at midnight. It caused him to leave the glory of heaven and come as a baby to Bethlehem where he didn't find refuge, where he was the outcast. There was no safe refuge for him there. And then quickly he was driven out having to flee for his life with his family into Egypt. And yet the love that is God and is within God caused Jesus to abandon that eternal glory of heaven and become a willing servant. Someone who had no reputation, who was despised and rejected by those who would eventually nail him to the cross. And there, in the midst of a darkness far deeper than any ordinary midnight, Jesus offers himself up for the sins of his people. And through that ultimate sacrifice, he offers us his name and he declares that everyone who trusts in him will be called children of God, heirs of the kingdom, included in the family because of our trust in him, our kinsman redeemer. So where do we go from here? What do we do with Ruth chapter 3? We turn to God in praise and thankfulness for all that Jesus has done for us. And then we turn to the world and we ask that God gives us eyes of compassion and hearts that are Charlie, that are noble, so that we might be those who, like Boaz, go out of our way for the stranger in our midst. And that we might be those who, like Naomi and Ruth, act with courage and determination to seek to find another way, even in the face of the human systems that we exist within, that have been broken by human sin. And in order to do those things, we will need to be brave and we will need to take risks. But when we do it, it will be totally worth it. Thank you, Gemma. Let's pause."

    "transcript": "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Today is a great day in the church. Today that we do remember and celebrate all of the saints in the church who recognize and celebrate. And it is a day that I normally ask a few questions. And one of the questions that I do ask is, if I was to ask you how you got here this morning, I would probably say you walked here. Others probably came by car. Probably some came on a train. So let's make a change of trains. But if I asked, in terms of faith, how did you get here? How did you come to know about faith? Most of us would mention someone who was very instrumental to them knowing about Jesus Christ. Someone who helped them to be able to become faithful followers of Jesus. And today is a day that we do stand and celebrate all these people who have made great contributions possible to ourselves. But those who have been faithful throughout the centuries and throughout generations in passing forth the message of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. Those who have been faithful as disciples of Jesus Christ. The key word here is faithful. It is not about comfort. It is not about having the best life. But those who in fact have been faithful despite all the challenges that life has brought. The gospel reading this morning is one that is really challenging. And some of the things that Jesus is saying here are really difficult. Really difficult. Love your enemies and pray for them. Some of us do not have enemies. I hope I don't have enemies. But that's really tough, isn't it? Blessed are you when people exclude you, revile you. Blessed are you when you are hungry, when you are poor. That's a feeling of being blessed. And then Jesus again comes around and says, woe unto you who are rich. For you have indeed received consolation. Don't spend it. It doesn't spend. Really. But today is a day that we do remember all those who are faithful. Who are able to walk the walk of faith. Upholding all the principles that Jesus Christ was speaking about. Our mind is what Jesus said to us. It is about remembering all those who, despite all these difficult challenges, they were faithful to Jesus. Those who, in the most difficult times, they were able to still find God and God who was able to build inside. Think about a gentleman like Paul of Charles and Paul. A gentleman who was very well educated, an artist. A man who had so many resources and went all out and applied himself to the persecutions, prisons. So on his way to Damascus, on his way to persecute more Christians, he met with Jesus. His life was transformed. And he continued to proclaim the gospel of our Savior Jesus Christ, even in the most difficult circumstances. Even himself personally, he kept on praying and asking God to take out the thorn from his flesh. Still, he was faithful. Think of Stephen, a young man. A gentleman who is continuing to follow Jesus Christ, the God of the Christ of death. But even when one walks in so-called incompetent, in so-called incompetent of others, and so on, even of the last kind of time. Who else in history would mention individuals who have been faithful in their faith? Some of whom we don't know, some who we really do. Since I arrived here two and a half years, my heart goes to know some of those faithful saints. Someone like George Mutton, who I met only briefly. But despite the fall of his going forth with him, he still had the time and the effort to look after us. His passion for scripture was indeed evident. Week after week, he shared and taught others to follow in faith. These days, you have a habit for me, from the bottom of my heart, I receive a piece of paper that George wrote from Paul's soap. And this is scripture, faithfulness. I remember, was commitment and dedication to fellowship, wasn't it? He made himself known as he came into this building very, very clearly. In your travels. But even in his sunset days, he still mustered up the energy and the courage to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with his wife. I met Edmund, an incredible human being who had an incredible gift of bringing joy everywhere he went. I was just saying to Carol on the road, but I was remembering, I do have a wonderful, wonderful picture of Carol, Eddie, and former Archbishop of Canterbury just in London, standing right above there at the Archbishop of Canterbury. And people just see the joy radiating from Edmund. I will forever remember at my licensing, being welcomed by Eddie, and him giving me a prayer book, saying, James, be among us one who calls us to prayer, as one who leads us in worship, in psalms, in silence, in prayer, and in praise. We may all be in God's image and likeness, and care for the needs of the church. I remember our sister Lydia, an incredible and formidable woman who suffered with illness and weakness. Every Sunday morning, in an incredible way, she was able to facilitate worship, helping us to sing praises and songs by operating on the love of the projector. Making sure that the best songs that you use for the Eucharist were always in spotlight. I remember Lydia's last visit to this building of public worship. She handed me some clean and fresh linen. Incredibly, even in spite of what's going on with her, she still found time to start. I have no...\n\nThere are so many people that have served in his life that we do not know very well, who have offered themselves to serve God faithfully. The fire that started to burn was a wow. That is in his family. That is in his family. What will we come to understand? These people formed a great crowd of witnesses. Those people who have rather completed their race of faith. Those are the people who today remember. As we remember, it was also recognized that they have won their race. They have finished. We are the ones who are on the track. On this journey, on this pilgrimage of faith, my prayer this morning is that you remember all the servants, known to us or unknown to us, those who are only known to us or those who we call as a worshipping community, remember them in this place. I still remember that my prayer that we may be inspired by their faithfulness and that the Spirit of God will grant them great fortitude, great courage to walk this walk of faith, to run the race and the battle to the faith and discipleship. Amen. When the saints go marching in, oh, when the saints go marching in, oh, Lord, I want to be in that number, oh, when the saints go marching in. When the saints go marching in, oh, when the saints go marching in, oh, Lord, I want to be in that number, oh, when the saints go marching in."

    "transcript": "Oh, thank you. So these guys are good friends and really smart people and really good to listen to. So I've invited these guys to come and talk to us and they'll tell us what they're going to talk about. But I'm just going to quickly pray for you and then you guys can plow in. So Lord, I thank you for Ben and for Diane. I thank you for the hearts that they have for you, the love they have for you and their track record with you as well. And we pray that you'd fill them afresh with your Holy Spirit as they speak to us. And we open our hearts to hear from you from what they have to share. In Jesus' name. Amen. Thanks, Daniel. So Daniel asked us to talk about giving this week. And so since British people find it awkward to talk about money, he's like, two Americans can do this. As they say, you know, in polite company never talks about religion and politics. And I think the reason why you're not allowed to talk about those is because both of them have to do with money. And one of these reasons actually is Protestants that we are hesitant to think about money and even perhaps the manipulation that comes with this is the whole reason the Protestant Reformation started or one of the main reasons was about how money was spent. So there were people buying bishop roles. So we have the new archbishop, right? So if you were wealthy, you could actually bid to buy the role like that. And actually one of the major things that started the Reformation was a capital campaign. The Catholic Church, the Pope was trying to build what is still today the largest church in the world, St. Peter's Basilica. And so it was an expensive venture. And one of the things that came out of that was the Pope didn't necessarily kind of advocate this directly, but in the German church there was a guy named Johann Tetzel who came up with a nice fundraising campaign to help encourage people to give money. They connected it with the idea of like if you're generous, then you wouldn't spend as much time in purgatory. And so this guy, Johann Tetzel, came up with a nice little jingle that anytime a coin in the box rings, a soul from purgatory springs. And so Martin Luther, his 99 theses or 95 theses were originally not against the Pope or anything else, but he was very much against this idea of using this way of using money to motivate people to give to the church and things like that. And so as Protestants, we have kind of brought this heritage that you shouldn't talk about money in church, right? Just let people do what they want to do. But you might remember a few months ago now, I guess, is when Emily preached about Acts 2 and has this list of the things that the church did. They devoted themselves to prayer, the apostles' teaching, and they gave to one another so that no one had any need. And so that this idea of giving is like one of the most core and central ideas about what it means to live the church and be in community together is to share. We're going to talk a lot about money here, but this isn't limited to money. Money is just one example of many, but it is something that the Bible talks about a lot. Jesus talked about money way more than he ever talked about hell or anything else like that. And so we're just giving attention to that. So part of our talk here is like our reticence to talk about money might come from our kind of communal heritage. We're also highly shaped by our family heritage. And so, Diane, I was going to ask you, what kind of views about money did you bring out of your family? Well, I consider myself really fortunate because I grew up in a Christian family that was very active in the church and really sought to live out and talked about the ways that they were enacting their faith. And one of those was giving. Certainly it was also quite a conservative Christian upbringing, and so we did talk about money. But that really was shaping to me because in my family we talked about God's generosity. We talked about giving as an act of worship, and we talked about then how our priorities were with our money. And then when things happened, we talked about that as well in light of faith. So when things were, yeah, all kinds of different financial situations. So I counted myself really blessed because that shaped me and gave me a basis on which to then move into my adult views of how giving works. How about you, Ben? Yeah, I grew up Baptist, and so they're one of the communities in the States that talks about like the tithe, the 10% is like the main thing. Like that's how you measure whether you're doing it right or not. So the tithe is just the, I guess, somewhere from a Hebrew word or maybe Latin, I don't know. But it goes back to Hebrew in the Old Testament that you would give 10% as the starting point. But you would have the tithes as the given, and then you would have offerings or the stuff that goes on top of that, so if there's other things. And so that kind of shaped my upbringing as like my faith heritage. My parents were actually quite, didn't always manage their money well, but they were generous people. So we would have people live with us at times, like my mother was a school teacher, and so we had one of her students that came and lived with us. I have two uncles that have had long-term disability issues that I know my parents have supported over many years now. And so in that sense of like there's this act of generosity to those that were not shaped or didn't have the means in the same way. And so it's that kind of a vision that has actually shaped my own call to ministry or what I worked with at the children's home. I've worked with transitional housing things and then even human trafficking, sex abuse outreach and things like this. But to those that didn't have as much in the way of this world's goods that God has called me specifically to help and serve in those ways. Well, let me ask you a question then. Is there a time in your life that giving was especially impactful to you? Well, there's been lots of times. I would say when we first got married, again, kind of bringing that idea of our foundation. When we first got married and we actually had our own very small bit of money enough to do beans on toast and that kind of thing. It was quite a blessing because Aaron also had grown up in a family that gave. And so for us, we could say, okay, here we are. We're starting our marriage. What is giving going to look like for us? And having had, you know, we were poor, newly married, very young people. But we said, okay, like we have had this testimony in our lives. And so we're going to go that way. We're going to give and it'll be the first thing that we give and we'll just trust God to make the rest all fine. And we have seen that over and over. And there have been a few times where, again, you know, stuff happens with your life circumstances or whatnot. And there's been one or two times in which we've gone, oh, you know, oh, you know, nope, nope. Think back of all the times God has provided. And so we've been able to then give and give and trust that God will provide still. So that's a giving kind of thing. The other side of giving is having generosity shown to you. And I think that's something that we're going to also talk about as we think about generosity. But here's a question for you all to turn to a neighbor. Tell a time or can you think of an example when someone's generosity has impacted you? Has there been a time that you can think of where someone's generosity, big thing, small thing, in any different kind of context, has been an impactful thing for you? We're going to give you just one minute. Turn to a little neighbor. GBC folks, help everybody feel included. Yeah, so the beautiful thing, there's so many stories of generosity of where we have needs. And other times they're not necessarily we have a need, but somebody just goes out of their way to bless you and to think about that. And so that's so much of what we're talking about here today is this idea of reciprocation, that we're part of this community and it's not always just someone giving, someone receiving, but we all have different ways. And so some of those things might have been financial. They might have been a gift of time. I know I moved, we moved house, I guess, about a year ago, and Aaron and one of their close family friends came and helped us move a large wardrobe. And it was like there's no way I could have done this on my own. And so it was just like\n\nTheir skills made all that. It was such a gift, you know. And so there's different ways that we can give and receive to one another. The one thing that we are thinking about here is like we're talking about giving. And so, of course, part of this is giving to the church. I don't think this is the only way that we give. But there is a question of like why would we give to the church? And Diane, I don't know, what do you think about giving to WTC? Or that, or that. Diane gives her time to WTC. We both work there together. And I have to fundraise for that too. So I can give you – I think there's good reasons why I can tell you that. Why do you give to GVC? Yeah, so why give to the church? I think there's many wonderful things to give to as well. But I think for me, particularly thinking about giving to the church, is critical in that if I belong to Jesus and I'm following him with all my life, I'm trying to shape who I am around following Jesus. And that includes how I give my time, how I give my money. And if I believe in the church being the body of Christ, being the hands and the feet of Jesus in the world, I want to invest as a priority into what the church and in our case this church is doing as are many, many churches, not just this church, but living out the call to mission that God's given us in the world. And so for me, that makes giving to the church part of a priority. There's lots of other reasons. Giving shapes our discipleship and many other kinds of things, but that's at least a starter of why give to church. Yeah, and if you're wondering what your money actually goes to in the church, we have a slide here. It's not as easy to read from far away. If you don't know, we have an annual presentation that about, I don't know, about what, three or four people show up to that Emily prepares diligently for. Does such a great job. It is literally the most exciting financial presentation I've seen in a church. It's colorful. Look at that. Bringing hope and joy to Gloucestershire. But as you'll see, the biggest part, and this is true in any church, in fact, we spend less on employees. It's usually around 55 to 60 percent is what an average church spends their time on is because we're in the people business. And so you hire people to give their time and energy to others. The other bit, is this mauve? I don't know what this color is on the bottom left. Fuchsia. Is for the venue hire. So it takes money to show up here and have the tea and toast place. We give. The blue part on the left is for us to give. You'll maybe know the heritage that the church started that giving a certain percent. I don't know if 10 percent was the original. That's right. And the goal is that we increase that as a percentage every year. So not just increase the amount that we give away, but that we're embodying generosity as a community. So I'll just say as a community, our giving is now we're seven years old and our giving is at 17 percent and it's set to go up again. So it's increased 1 percent a year since its inception. And so there's lots of things that that goes into. And then the rest is all the other things that are part of existing in the modern world. So paying professional services and things like this. So in this sense, as you may not know this, my first degree was in accounting. And so for years I've done finance work. This is all very standard for a church. And in fact, it's the giving percentage of our church back, the Sugar Land Vineyard, is much less than this. And so it's not that it's all being absorbed. And I know in this sense, like Daniel and Emily volunteer. If we paid them an hourly rate, it would be probably ridiculously small because I know they do more work than what they're paid for. So in that sense, I as a giver don't have any hesitation that my money is being poorly spent here. So one of the things we like to talk about is looking at the Bible and maybe just chatting through some biblical passages that are formative. Do you want to do the Genesis one there first? I'm number one. Yeah. So you might think, oh, where would you look in the Bible for giving? And one of the things I love about thinking about giving is from Genesis 1 and 2. So right back at the beginning of the Bible, the creation story. And when God made people, he made creation. It's amazing. It's a place of abundance. There is enough. And sometimes I think we think, oh, man, we're living in scarcity. Creation is a place of abundance and enough. And then God gave people the charge, the job to steward what God had made. He gave us responsibility for it and said, make something of it. Steward this world that I've given you to cultivate it. And so actually, I think giving starts with this. One of the threads is that we are stewarding what God has entrusted to us. And that is a personal thing. Everything that I have, my life and my junk, my stuff, my money, it's all God's. He's entrusted it to me to steward well. And so part of what I'm doing when I'm thinking about giving is going back to that charge and job that I've been giving to steward in the well. And that includes my giving. So it all belongs to God, and I'm giving back from that. And it's out of that then that the Old Testament talks about the 10%. If you're actually interested in this, it isn't just 10% in the Old Testament. It's 10% on an annual basis, but then there are certain years when you give even more than just that. So you would pay for not just your own tithes and offerings. The Deuteronomy 14 is if you want to get into that. I was thinking about Matthew 6 is the passage that is one that some may be familiar with. It says, when you give, don't trumpet it to the rest on the streets that you're giving. In fact, you should give in a way that your right hand doesn't know what your left hand is doing. And so sometimes we're like, well, this is why we should never talk about money then. It's like I shouldn't even have a sense of what's going on somewhere else. But he also puts this in the same conversation of praying. And we don't have any problem. He says, now don't let your prayers be trumpeted out to where everybody sees them so that you're doing it for show. The whole idea is let it be out of motivation from your heart, not for something that you receive back. And we see this in the rest of Matthew 6 as well too. And later in the chapter, Jesus says, now don't worry about what you're going to wear, what you're going to eat, because God will provide these things in the same way that he provides for the animals of the field. In fact, he says, seek first the kingdom of God because that's where your treasure is. That's where your heart will be also. And so let your treasures be invested in the kingdom. And again, it's not that the church itself is where the kingdom only is. God's doing all sorts of things. But that is one thing. And one of the things that's interesting to me about Matthew 6 is that he talks early about praying, so you're giving up your time in prayer. And giving, you're giving up your money, right, and giving or resources. But then he also talks about fasting and so giving up food. These are the big discipleship markers. And what he's saying is live your life with an open hand. Don't grasp after these things. And I think actually that's what leads into not having anxiety about these things. If you live your life with an open hand, then you're not anxious when they come and go. Because as you were saying, like God's the owner of this. We're just renters. We're letting his space that he's sharing with us in this. The thing I love from that, it helps me remember where is my security. Where is my security? It's not in my bank balance or it's not in the stuff that I have or the positions I might have or any of those things. And if we can hold our security and our identity with Christ in who he is and in his goodness, then it allows us that open-handedness. And it helps us to reshape those priorities. Yeah. Brilliant. So there's a couple other passages, 2 Corinthians 8. Let me grab that. Might have a couple verses there. I can't read them. I can't see them.\n\n2 Corinthians 8. Well, I've got it in different versions. It says, They are being tested by many troubles and they are very poor, but they are also filled with abundant joy, which has overflowed in rich generosity. And so then verse 8. 9. Okay, 9. You know the generous grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor so that by his poverty he could make you rich. And so this contrast here of rich and poor and the language that is being used here. Here is a giving passage here is Paul speaking to people who are giving. They're giving to a church that has need. And he's saying, yes, though you were poor, you were generous. But it comes first from Christ. Christ was poor and yet gave. And actually, God's grace that we see in Christ is the most generous act we could ever imagine. God's generosity to us sets the standard and enables us to then return back generosity. What do you think about that passage? Yeah, just that first verse. Oftentimes we think, oh, I don't have much to give. And he's using the example of people that didn't have a lot of financial resources. And so part of their giving was financial, but there are all different ways that we can give. I think some of us have all different gifts. I think about spiritual gifts here, for instance. If you're a believer and the spirit is in you, then you have a gift to share with other people. And so that might be encouragement, teaching, mercy. Giving is one of those. Faith. There's all these things that we have to give. Maybe you have just a seat in your lounge that somebody else could sit in for a cup of tea. Right? I mean, there's all these different things. It turns out I learned that I have the gift of a southern accent. You may not be thinking like, oh, what is my gift? It's like, well, people, for whatever reason here in Texas, they don't find my accent. In fact, it helps them go to sleep, I think. Maybe it's a gift in that way. But here it's interesting. It's different, right? And so we all have something whether we think we know it or not. And I think that's with the Macedonians here. There's actually two whole chapters in 2 Corinthians about giving. So this was from chapter 8. There's another one in chapter 9. And this is one that sometimes makes us a bit nervous. Verse 6 there says, whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. And whoever sows generously will reap generously. And this is interesting. Sometimes maybe you've heard of the prosperity gospel, that if you live right and you believe right, prosperity is going to come back to you. And so we're a bit nervous with that because like, well, suffering happens and sickness and things. But I think sometimes we swing the pendulum too far in the correction. It's like, no, if you go on to verse 11 there, it says, you'll be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion. And through us, your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God. And so in this sense, if God's saying like, he's going to provide our needs. And so the more generous we are, actually oftentimes God will give us more to be generous with. And so in that sense then, it's not so much that it comes back to us, that this moreness is for us just to live a nicer life or something. But God does invest resources in people that use them for the kingdom. And so in that sense, I think part of this is we just think about what are ways that we can step out that would be generous. I mean, it's one of those questions I think between these two chapters that sticks out to me is like, would somebody accuse you of being a generous person? So often we're thinking about percentages and 10%, whether that's right or wrong. And I think it's a good starting point myself. I'm of the opinion that if God says something in the Old Testament, it doesn't just automatically go away when we come to the New Testament. He has all other ethical commands that we think are very important out of the Old Testament. And so we don't have any problem following those. And the 10% is never repeated in the New Testament, so people will debate about that. But the question about generosity is like, would somebody accuse you of being generous? That's what Paul's argument here is. And I think in that sense, there are things that are easier for us to be generous with. It just so happens Heather and I are at a time of life with our kids are out of the house. It's easier for us to be generous with our money than it is to be with our time right now because of the transition we have. There are other seasons of life when you have a lot more time and you don't have money or whatever it is. The question is, it's not always what it is, but how are you allowing God to use you in that? We'll hold it at the end, if you will. There you go. I think it really speaks to attitudes too, doesn't it? Both of these passages and it helps us remember, you know, God loves a cheerful giver. The idea of giving, Paul talks in both of these chapters about giving generously, but giving joyfully. Giving with confidence. Giving because it's not from obligation. It's not from guilt. It's giving that open-handed kind of thing. And that is a wonderful thing to help us say, actually, how can I give? How can I come before the Lord? And if I can't give joyfully, there's something I can think about. Maybe I need to do some conversation with the Lord and say, what is it inside that makes me, is it fear? Am I fearful to give? Is there a narrative around us in our society that I've bought into and that makes me fearful to give? So giving attitudes, Scripture is really concerned about how we give in our hearts. I think we're at time here. We're close. I'm going to, if you have any final things to say. Well, if we get really practical, like how does planning for giving affect the rest of budgeting and spending in your experience? Yeah, I think in this sense for us, it's not living with 100% of our budget in this sense. Part of this is so that we have the flexibility when somebody has need around us to give. If we're spending 100% and even on good and right things, that means there's nothing left there. There's no margin there. And so just trying to live a step back from where the margin, so there's always margin in our budget is something that Heather and I. And God's calling the first 15 years of our marriage, we lived off of one salary. And so it trained our kind of wants and needs to be. And when we moved here, one of the things was like, well, we can't move all of our junk across the ocean. And so let's go through the calling process and got rid of about 85% of our stuff. And part of this is like our lives are just driven by stuff. And I think it's healthy at different points to be like, just set a marker and say like, let's have a real accounting here. What do I really need? And what am I just dragging with me? And actually, what is keeping up with all that stuff actually takes more time and energy. And so it just frees up the ability to be more generous with your resources. I would say if giving is something that you are just thinking about or maybe you're reconsidering or you haven't ever thought about, my encouragement would be pray and ask the Lord to give you a starting point. Start somewhere. Give regularly, like plan it. It helps form us when we're giving regularly because it becomes then setting a priority and it shapes who we are and allows God to shape us. So start somewhere. And then in our habit is, yeah, reconsider and think, am I giving generously? Yeah. Here we go. And as we were finishing here, so we'll hand over. But one of the things as we come to the table here to celebrate communion, one of the things is celebrating God's abundance. His grace is enough. And so the whole idea is not to give out of emptiness or try to scrape something together. It's to recognize that God has given all of us great things through Christ and through our individual gifts as well. And so as you come to the table, think about God's generosity that he gives us, even the gifts we don't deserve, but use that also as a challenge to consider how you might use that grace that he has given you. Amen. Amen."

    "transcript": "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Today is Bible Sunday. It's an invitation to look on what first hit me, what we call the basis of so much of our worship. What we read Sunday by Sunday, most of us, the ESV, the Father 12. I'm sure you know that the word Bible doesn't mean a talking back, it means a library. So what? It means a book from the Bible. Written by very many people, intended to be read to different audiences. They're saying audiences, rather than readers, which is very sparse. It's the word Bible. It is not being read privately, but being proclaimed loudly. It's not just studied by people who have it in their hands. And hopefully you can cover something of the enthusiasm that raised that message up to be proclaimed. It's very different from the Bible, it's not just the book. We need to be careful of occupying a lot more space for other books. And yet, we can't change it. Nowadays, if we want to get a message across, what do you do? You don't get on television, I suppose. Or write a blog, but you somehow ensure it goes viral. What I'm trying to say is it's very hard to predict what will go viral and what will stay unread. But in the slightly more than a thousand years the Bible was being put together, there we are, it's a shout. Loudly through the marketplace. Or at the gates. You'll see many references to the gates in the Bible. It's the place, the end of the town where the senior men of the town got together to discuss legal matters. To deal with what was happening in various cases. Or perhaps at the door of the king's palace. I hope you might hear you. It's a bit amusing, isn't it? Or of course, we need to get more organized. We have the opportunity of a congregation that was gathered together. Synagogue. The word synagogue and congregation means actually the same thing, gathering. It was gathering together to worship God. And what better place would it be for proclaiming the word of God to the faithful than where they were gathering already? It would be there and here. That means here. The difficult responsibility of proclaiming the word of all the prophets. Not much predicted of the future. But commentators have always been on the dime. They don't probably have a Bible still. Nor a written book. We have books of the prophets. Lots and lots of them. Either proclaiming to the tribes of Judah, the southern tribe. The two tribes of the left after the Jewish split. Or the ten tribes of Israel. And before, of course, the kingdom was established. All people spoke the word of God to the people. And that can't have been an easy, persuading, difficult day in the midst of a soft and a program. So there were many people proclaiming the word of God. Some of them were genuine. Some were not so genuine. But they did make a living out of it. Except for those who were proclaimed also maybe down. But before the skies. It's got to be a very bad message in the New Testament. But we didn't depend on the written record. The skies. The right. So they would have listened to the prophets that had spoken. And then they would have written down something. And of course, with all these voices, live audiences, they would have piqued themselves an awful lot. And sometimes the Bible would be very repetitive. Other times it seems like different versions of the same thing. Sometimes it's even books. And it's time for those writings to come together. Eventually, in a book, the book of Isaiah. The book of the prophet Isaiah. Well clearly, in Hebrew, that's the image audiences that Isaiah spoke. They wrote something down. And then what they did, they said something like this next time. But in these days, they went on speaking by reading out the son and the truth as well. A few books of the world. Eventually, it finished up with the book we have. It started off in the time of Isaiah. Of the Caesar round, the man of the game. He was around. He takes his mentions very early on in the book of Isaiah. The later books were addressed to people in exile. In Babylon. Long after that. But they were long, the same strand of prophecy. But it started like Isaiah. And so we have four. It tells us so much about history. And it can reach up to us. No one can do anything. But the prophet, one who writes that the Jewish people have preserved and protected the messenger. He didn't stop them in his early act. With tablets and what the nation are. They wrote those few commented on sections. They found those who were wise and followed the original message. The message of the prophets. The message actually of the whole school of prophecy. In his family. And so the main books of the Bible came together relatively. No arguments of course about what to go in and what to stay out. Now a lot of it isn't necessary to write down the law. Now of course it started with people remembering. And then people came across a situation they had to reply. And they thought, how does that work? So they answered that question and wrote it down. And so there develops a great corpus of law. Mixed in of course with the story. The law essentially based on stories. What happened in a similar situation? There were the books of the law. This is the story of Moses. The sending of the law. The time of the kings. It's not the wrong path. Or over the earth. The law and the prophets. That phrase sounds familiar doesn't it? And of course it's that that the Old Testament, the writings. So this is follows of the antiquity.\n\nand dancing. And also, he was very people. Very, very much. Those three things together, they combined. Through that Bible, for Jesus knew, he scolded, and nobody had books like we had in those days. He scolded and painted to him. He read the Hebrew, and commented on it. In the way that the synagogue would comment on it. And he would have commented on it in the language of time. It wasn't the same as in the text. The teachers would have spoken about it. The development of Hebrew. And the Hebrew had been learned quite separately from the language of the normal age. A bit like, I suppose, the English and the Anglo-Saxon. If I don't understand it, it's not that easy. But that's what Jesus was doing. Translating it, explaining it. In the biblical record of the story, he reached his meeting. I'm not saying he must have been busy in those days. My dad would have told us about this all those years ago. We're all descendants from translations. So remember that this Bible Sunday, let us all of us think of all of those who are finding translations in news. For those taken out processed for languages. The benefit of people overseas perhaps. I think languages are much rarer. The Bible in their own language. It's worth saying other languages. Fairly thought about it in work on those translations. And it's the work itself of those translating. The benefit of those in other countries. Without a total grasp of English as their native language. They used to work with our authors. Speaking English all the way. And they're not much deeper understanding of the privilege we take for granted. And here they brought students in our own language. The third part is not about the Old Testament. It's Jewish in Hebrew. It's written out there. The second process may go on to New Testament. Because all the words of Jesus have been translated for us. There's no written record. But in Hebrew or Aramaic. We can't say back in our native tongue. It's all about Jesus. He's our media language. It's all about the words of the author. But the Bible, the New Testament and the Old Testament are again spoken. Probably not so much about the theory. But about the practice of the academic process of the scribes and Paul. If you like perhaps. It might be a bit more spoken. And people are uncomfortable with Jesus. Wanting to know more. Asking one another. Let's go and have something else. About the stories told. About the miracles of Jesus. We talked about it. Some of them wrote bits down. The grandfathers got put together. By people called Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Look at their names. We're not really sure about their identity. We think it was just us as we call. Quite likely it was. He was one of the ones who put them together. Or was he one of the ones who was a scribe? Somebody else put him on the book. Or she put the book back. But he's got to do with the academic process. We don't know. They might have said that. But we got Matthew. We got him. Go back to Jesus. And he revealed himself. He didn't realise. But he went on believing himself. With God's spirit. To the congregations of that day. Whatever the mechanism of how the Bible came to be. Key is your Holy Service. We don't have a guidance for the Holy Service. The reading of the Bible. Hundreds of people involved. In talking about these things. Writing them down. Gathering them together. Separating the truth from the untruth. The made up. Putting together the work that we now know as the Bible. God speaking to us. The Bible. And the Bible. And the Bible. But let's realise that's how many people are involved. Perhaps something much bigger here. Those first stories. Those first prophecies. In the Matt first normal. And that's the joy. There's so many people involved in that process. And you are too. And you. Talking about the stories of Jesus. Or the stories of Moses coming back. And you telling the apostles. Something about the third. What we wrote. The very stories. Even making a difference in your life. And the lives of the human family. Don't miss that. Be relaxed. There are many people involved in that process. Gathering the Bible together. And expressing it in our language with other sometimes. But let's all be aware. The Father in each of us. And finally. Spreading that same word of God. In the world. Amen."

    "transcript": "Carrie is going to share with us today, and I'm just kind of going to prompt her with some questions. But today we're going to be talking about safeguarding. Yes! So I'm sure that safeguarding is something that all of us have heard of, and different ones of us have encountered safeguarding in different ways in the real world. Maybe it's in a work context or in a church context, or hearing safeguarding represented on the news somehow. Today we're going to be talking about safeguarding within church life. But this is not safeguarding training, okay? You're not going to leave from today with a certificate. Instead, Carrie and I are going to be talking about why safeguarding is central to the gospel. Our intention today is to inspire each of us to see how safeguarding is not an additional extra to the gospel. It's not a boring and annoying impediment to the gospel, but actually that it sits right at the very heart of the gospel. And when we say, yes, so somebody just said yes. So if anything that's said today you agree with, as ever with Gloucester Vineyard Church, we would love to hear that affirmation. So if you agree, then like yes, come on, amen. Hallelujah. All of those things are good today, so let's have some of those. So today, so I've just used the word gospel a lot. Just to define that term, when we talk about the gospel, we mean the good news that Jesus Christ came to earth 2,000 years ago, that he became like us in every way, that he lived a fully human life like ours, that he announced and demonstrated the kingdom of God was arriving, that he was crucified, that he died, that he rose from the dead, he ascended to heaven and established the church, and so much more. That is the gospel, that's the good news. And we have the contention that our responsibilities to be a safeguarding church sit right at the heart of the gospel. And so that's what we're going to be unpacking today. But to start with, Carrie, why don't you introduce yourself? Oh, you haven't got a microphone, that's awful. I can shout. Yeah, very good. Hello, everybody. Thank you so much for inviting me to speak today. It's a good start. So I've been asked to tell you a little bit about myself and my journey as a Christian. So I was fortunate to be born into a Christian family and as a little girl went to a very traditional Anglican church that was kind of struggling with that move between tradition and modernity. And it wasn't always obvious to me as a little girl where God's vision for the world was in that space. It felt like people were going through the motions and it felt like it had little impact beyond the door of that church. However, I was lucky. My parents were always an amazing example to me of what God's love for the world looks like. And so I've really grown up admiring their approach to public service, the way that they cared for their family, their hospitality, their generosity, and just generally how they modeled servant-heartedness to me. So I have always called myself a Christian, but I think it probably wasn't until I was in my early 20s that I started to have a think about what that actually means for me and for who I am in God. I spent some time living in Leeds and was part of a really big church up in Leeds and felt quite out of place in that space. But whilst I was there, God really called me to have a heart for women who were involved in street sex work. And the way that God works is that he makes that possible. And so a few weeks after I'd been kind of praying around that, an organization called the Joanna Project came and spoke at my church. So the Joanna Project are an amazing charity who provide outreach and support to women who have been or are involved in street sex work. These women are some of the most vulnerable women we have in our communities. They're often placed outside the bounds of our communities. They're not seen as members of our community. They're treated appallingly by men. And they're also treated appallingly by the systems that should be there to protect them. However, the Joanna Project showed me God's vision for these women. And that vision was to provide hope, to provide love, and to provide dignity so that they could live a life that was full in all its abundance. So this is where God really showed me his vision for his love in the world and my role seeking justice within that. So fast forward a few more years, I moved to Gloucestershire and I still volunteer with a street sex work outreach organization. But God has also put me in a place of employment where I have the opportunity to shape the system that people facing disadvantage often don't get the best responses from. So this involves me spending a lot of time trying to persuade people that hold quite a lot of power that we need to do things better and we need to do things differently. It also involves funding services that provide physical safe spaces for people to live. So I feel really privileged that God has put me where he's put me in a space where he is using my skills and my passion for justice. I mean, right? Come on. So how cool is it to have Carrie speaking to us today? We've also invited Carrie to come and speak to us because you are Gloucester Vineyard Church's safeguarding lead. So could you really quickly share to us what you do as safeguarding lead and what exactly does that mean? Yeah, sure. So essentially I am helping Gloucester Vineyard Church ensure it's a safe space for people who we may see as being vulnerable. So this includes all of our kids, our young people and adults within our community who may have care and support needs. When we talk about care and support needs, what we're talking about that's kind of a legal definition. But essentially what it means is people who need support around practical things, financial things, emotional things, who just need that extra help to manage their lives to be independent. So this includes older people, it includes people who have disabilities or long-term illnesses, people with mental health difficulties and people who care for those individuals. So practically what that looks like in the church is involving that, making sure that we have an up-to-date safeguarding policy. So having a policy that is something that we follow in our practice that informs the way that we do things. It also involves supporting those who work and volunteer in the church with support and training to understand what those responsibilities look like so that we are all skilled to recognize abuse and neglect and safeguard everyone that comes to be part of this church. It also means listening to any concerns that come up, so seeking people who may need some advice and providing that advice and responding to safeguarding concerns in kind of timely ways and appropriate ways. But it also means sitting here and talking to you and reassuring you that it's okay to raise a concern if you're worried about somebody, it's okay to come forward with that because safeguarding is really a responsibility that we all have. It's not something that Emily and Daniel have as leaders here, it's something that we're all responsible for. More than that though, as Christians, it's our calling to follow Jesus who we can kind of see as the ultimate safeguarding champion and to make it our business to care about children and adults who are at risk of harm in this church. More broadly though, I think my role is also to be part of supporting GVC to be a place where we're all safe in all of our vulnerabilities and brokenness, where we are all invested in maintaining safety and where we can really cultivate a culture of care, deep care for each other and our local community. Brilliant. A quick show of hands, how many people encounter safeguarding on a fairly regular basis in their work? Yeah, so fair few of us have kind of heard about this. Safeguarding seems to be everywhere at the moment. I'm sure as we've just seen, we all kind of encounter safeguarding in some way, shape or form. Seems like a really big thing to me, but it also seems like quite a recent thing as well. Does anyone resonate with that? Like I can remember a time before safeguarding. Can you tell us a little bit more about where this idea, where this language has come from and why it seems to be everywhere? Yeah, sure. So in terms of safeguarding as a kind of legal thing and in terms of it being something that we have to do, so a practice, it is quite rightly an ever evolving thing. But if we look at it in kind of the last, kind of if we're thinking about history of safeguarding, then safeguarding children and the formal frameworks that we have for child protection have only really been around for the last 80 years. Sadly, as is the case with lots of legislation and policy change, it often comes from reviews of tragic circumstances. So circumstances where we get things wrong. So often the deaths of children have informed changes in policy and practice and legislation. So in more recent\n\nIn history, you may have heard the names Victoria Climby, Holly Wells, Jessica Chapman. Their tragic deaths have shaped the way that we protect children today. If we think about adults, then we've got a bit of legislation called the Care Act 2014. This established kind of what we know safeguarding to be today. It's what we call a statutory duty. What that means is that it's something that councils, local authorities must do, and they must do it in a certain way. So it sets out the way that we have to do that duty. It also provides us with definitions of different types of abuse and neglect that people who are particularly vulnerable may experience. But it also includes some types of abuse that we might not think of as being so obvious in terms of safeguarding. So things like modern slavery are included. Things like institutional abuse are also included. So for both children and adults, most of the legislation we've got has been put in place in the last 20 years or so, and is informed by continued tragedies, continued situations where things haven't gone the way that they should have gone. So we've still got a really long way to go, even though we've got this legislation. We've still got a long way to go to ensure that victims of abuse are heard and first and foremost believed. So our initial response needs to be listening, not making assumptions, not passing judgment, but taking concerns seriously when they're raised is really important. So it's been kind of interesting for me personally, just as I've been leading and managing in different contexts, to kind of see the rise of safeguarding over the last 10 to 15 years and see it come into more and more spaces. And one of the things that I've observed, I've kind of seen a spectrum of ways that organizations tend to respond to safeguarding. Some will kind of go to one end of the spectrum and kind of risk assess themselves into a corner and feel like, oh, we can't do anything because everything is a risk. And so we kind of don't do what we should be doing. And then on the other end of the spectrum, you see organizations who are almost kind of scornful of safeguarding and kind of almost treat it like political correctness gone mad or like a nuisance box ticking exercise that we have to go through. Something that's just kind of got to be out of the way, get out of the way, just do the safeguarding thing and then we can crack on. Do you see that? Do you have any thoughts about that? So I think I didn't feel like I can come here today and say that we get it right because I think we need to start by recognizing that this is unfortunately something that the wider church has historically got very, very wrong on individual and organizational levels. So there have been systemic safeguarding failures across the global church. And I find that personally really difficult to reconcile that we are all reading the same gospel and yet we are behaving in ways that are really problematic and harmful. So we have this amazing commission from God and a gospel vision for our role in the world as peacemakers, as those who care for the abused and the oppressed. And then on the other hand, we have historically seen the church as sites of horrendous abuse. We have seen faith be weaponized. We have seen hierarchies of power that have protected abusers. We have seen victims not be heard. We've seen victims not be believed. And we've seen things covered up. And we've got to do better. So I continue to pray that God really breaks through in that space. I've already told you that I grew up as an Anglican, so I'm not outing myself as an Anglican. But I'm really encouraged that the new Archbishop of Canterbury, who's also a woman, has a really strong record on safeguarding. I think it's absolutely intentional that that is a skill set within the person that they have appointed to such an influential post. I pray that her example will be a real model to the church in all its forms across the world. That we see through her that we're called to be a people that speak up. That we are called to be a people whose hearts are broken for those facing disadvantage and abuse. And that we can, through that, become a people who are deeply invested in changing the hearts, minds, and behaviors of those who abuse. Bringing it back to the practicalities of doing safeguarding well, I think we can overcomplicate it. We can get bogged down in policy, process, legislation. Although those things are all really important, they're there to support us to be safe. There's kind of a middle ground, I think, that's important where we locate safeguarding as part of our duty of care. And that's part of our duty of care to all in our community. It's our kingdom work. It's foundational to the way that we welcome people. Whether that's at Chai and Chat or on a Sunday afternoon here. It's part of the way we walk alongside people in community and meet people's needs. So thinking about how we do our home groups, how we have conversations over tea and toast, how we welcome families and provide them with clothing at Grow Baby. So I think if we can see this as foundational in our culture of modeling Jesus' example, our attempts to, as Christians, become more like him, then we stand the best chance of it not being just what we do, but who we are. Yeah, agreed. Yeah, yeah. So we've mentioned that Carrie is our safeguarding lead. I just wanted to take a quick moment to voice, some of you may know this, that being a safeguarding lead for a church is often a tricky job. And it takes a lot of hard work behind the scenes. And it's often not particularly pleasant. But as Carrie has shared, we do have a statutory duty to do it, but we also have a wonderful gospel duty to do it as well. So can we embarrass Carrie by saying thank you to her by giving a quick round of applause? And before we move on, I also wanted to ask you guys to commit to pray for Carrie in what she does, because she is doing something which is an enormous act of service for our church. And we really want to back her with prayer, don't we? Because we're super grateful for what she does. There's a lot that happens behind the scenes that most of us just simply won't know about. So please take a moment to say thank you to her personally as well. Gotcha. So Carrie, why don't you tell us, from your perspective, as a church and as followers of Jesus, what is the position that you think we should take? Why do you think that safeguarding is kind of core and central to the gospel? Sure. So safeguarding for me is about righteousness and justice. It's about how we reflect God and how that shapes our identity as being made in God's image. It's about a choice we have between either benefiting from injustices and our own levels of privilege, or being a people who want to follow Jesus by healing the brokenness of our world. I think it's what we're called to do as followers of Jesus. And for me, rather than it being something that's an additional extra to the gospel message, or an annoying impediment to the work of the gospel, I feel safeguarding is core to the gospel itself. It's a fundamental element of God's work in the world through history from the beginning of time. Our lovely Sarah calls it a gospel imperative, and I really like that word imperative. It is something we must do. These ideas we find woven the whole way through the Bible. They are seen in the interactions between God and the lives of people we meet in the Old Testament. Then at the core of the New Testament, we're presented with radical justice, which we see embodied in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. So as we read through the first part of our Bibles, the bit we call the Old Testament, we find ourselves in a story that starts with brokenness, starts with this beautifully created world going absolutely wrong. So where our relationship with God and with each other and the world was broken by selfishness and self-centeredness, and where humanity is forced to go on through human history trying to work ourselves out of that space, working out how to relate to God within that, the way we relate to each other and the world in a way that is good, just, and meaningful. It's an ongoing thing for all of us to work out. So interestingly, humanity throughout all of that never loses its God-given commission to govern the world on his behalf and by his wisdom. So what we see is hundreds and hundreds of years, generation after generation of humanity walking through life trying to work that out. Trying to see how are we going to live a good life? How are we going to function in this world that's broken? How are we going to relate to God?\n\nto each other and the world. Thankfully, as with everything, we're not doing this on our own. God is not silent on this subject. So throughout the Bible, God reveals himself. He reveals himself to the people of the Old Testament in the form of instructions. We're given laws and principles on how we form communities. And we also see this in how he works directly through spokespeople that we call prophets. So he chose so many different ways of revealing himself and communicating his heart to the people of the Old Testament over the years. So what amazes me is that God doesn't just give cold instructions and commands to his people. In that, we see he reveals something of his nature and character. He reveals a deep longing and motivations. And we get to know more of God in his vision for righteousness and justice on earth. So if you use those words a couple of times, and they can be used to mean all sorts of things. So we'll start with the word righteousness. Are you going to use some ancient Hebrew now? Oh, I'm not going to say the word. Go on, you've got to do it. Give it a go. So I have heard the Hebrew word for righteousness, tzedeq. Yes. Thanks, Sarah. So we find that word in the Bible, and we can see it being discussed by people who know a lot more than I do as being about what is right and just in line with God's moral order. It's about our ethical standard for us and our relationships. Now on to justice. So we associate the word justice most often with the concept of someone facing the consequences of their actions. But in the Bible, the Hebrew word for justice is used to build an understanding of the just nature of God. And most of what we see in the Bible is all about restorative justice. It's actively seeking out vulnerable people who are being taken advantage of and helping them. It's about charity. It's about advocating for the vulnerable, challenging the structures within our society that maintain oppression and disadvantage. If we look at the book of Micah, this is spelled out really clearly. So Micah 6 verse 8 says, God has told you what is good. Do justice, love mercy, walk humbly with God. Simple, right? If we look at the instructions that God gave to ancient Israel about how they should organize themselves as a society, there is an incredible weight towards the poor, the marginalized, the oppressed, and the victim. Of all the instructions that we have written in our Bibles, those big long lists of commands that we find in books like Deuteronomy and Leviticus, about 35 to 40% of them are all about restorative justice. They're about being compassionate, about being in active community that prioritizes care for the victim and the oppressed. And that's a huge proportion if we think about it in percentages. What's more, we don't think that the laws and commands and instructions we have in our Bibles is everything that we need or that ancient Israel would have needed to create and run their society. There were many more instructions that we just don't have access to anymore. So it's really striking, I think, that the commands that we do have are the ones that have been passed on. These are the ones that have been prioritized in communication and I think that's important for showing us so much of God's heart. There's a phrase that crops up in our Bibles again and again in the Old Testament when we are looking at God's heart for the poor and the marginalized, and that's around the widow, the orphan, and the foreigner. So Deuteronomy 10, we hear, he ensures that orphans and widows receive justice. He shows love to the foreigners living among you and gives them food and clothing. So you too must show love to foreigners, for you yourselves were once foreigners in the land of Egypt. And in Psalm 68, we hear, Father to the fatherless, defender of widows, this is God whose dwelling is holy. God places the lonely in families. He sets the prisoners free and gives them joy. So this little phrase, widow, orphan, and foreigner, I think can be used as a bit of a kind of catch-all for all of the most vulnerable members of our society. Those that don't have stable home situations, those who are at risk of harm or abuse because they don't have adequate protection or because they don't belong to any of the existing systems or can't access those systems. God makes it really clear to us that his community should care very deeply for those who would be considered vulnerable for whatever reason. And so for me, it's also been something that I have seen really clearly in Jesus' ministry in the early church. So when he began his public ministry and announced his mission to the world, he quoted a passage from one of the Old Testament prophets and he applied it to himself and to his ministry. This is in Luke 4. He says, The spirit of the Lord is on me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of the sights to the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour. We also see Jesus' brother James writing to the early church and he wrote this. It's in James 1. Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you. So I think whenever we hear that little phrase in our Bibles, when we hear of widows, orphans and foreigners, we should immediately think of this kind of broader group of vulnerable people. So I think it's really helpful for us to identify that safeguarding is all about vulnerable people. However they are vulnerable, however they're at risk of harm or abuse. And I think there are so many examples that we could have put in our chat today from the Bibles, so many verses that talk to the topic of safeguarding. And throughout the message is so clear. So I think communities that seek to represent God faithfully should structure themselves in such a way that the vulnerable are cared for, that they're protected, they're provided for and they're championed. I really believe that we are called to be a people who live a radical and selfless way of life rooted in our understanding of who we are in God and our knowledge of what Jesus did for us. God declared Jesus the righteous one in death, but he came back and offered us all the chance of righteousness. Even though we're selfish, we're broken, we're guilty of benefiting from injustices. And for me, this is what should compel us to seek justice. Because even though we all fall short, we all have a part to play in the restoration and healing of our communities and our world. So I think if we want to be a faithful Jesus community representing God's heart to the world, then care and attention towards the vulnerable is not an optional extra for us. It has to be at the core, a defining feature of who we are. So we're called to be a community who asks, who are the vulnerable people around us? And how can we best serve them and care for them? So for me, this is why it's not only a duty for us, but a part of our joy to take safeguarding so seriously in everything we do and see it as just a core thing that we do as Christians. Because in looking out for the vulnerable people inside and outside of our contexts is in absolute parallel with how God looks at the world and what he expects his communities to be doing. Amen. Come on. Isn't that good? Embo, what's happening with the kiddos? Are they going to stay over there? Okay, great. So if you've got kids over in kids' church, they're going to stay over there. We're just going to take a couple of minutes to wrap up, just going to get really, really practical. And then we're going to pray to finish and then go over for tea and toast. So to wrap up, one of the things we highlight fairly regularly is how people can report a concern if they have one. We have a nifty email address, which is safeguarding at glostervineyard.org, where you can email Carrie directly and you can highlight your concern to her. Could I just make a quick request that unless the concern is really, really urgent, we don't bring them to Carrie on a Sunday whilst she's here. It's really kind of compassionate and kind to Carrie to put that in.\n\nemail. I'm not responding to anything by the way. No one's done this. But as I was writing this I was thinking, oh if I was in Carrie's shoes that would be just the worst. So let's respect Carrie as our safeguarding lead. If you do have something you want to raise, please use that email address and let Carrie just come and worship because this is her church community. Carrie, is there anything you'd like to say about highlighting a concern? When should people be thinking they might need to do it? And yeah, when should they be thinking, oh I might need to talk to Carrie about that? Yeah, sure. So really, anytime you are worried that an adult who you think has care and support needs or a child, so just a reminder about care and support needs, that's about an adult who you think might be vulnerable for whatever reason, or a child is at risk of abuse or neglect. You do not need proof of that. You do not need evidence of that. Please don't go all Agatha Christie and start investigating anything. You just need to have a reasonable cause to suspect that somebody is at risk of harm. So even if you are unsure, it is always better to bring it to a safeguarding person. So it's always better to highlight it than not. I'd also say that even if something doesn't then transpire to fit that kind of legal definition of safeguarding that does have kind of certain parameters, actually there might be something that as a church we need to be doing on a pastoral level to support that person. What if I have a concern about someone who's a friend of mine or a fellow church member that I know and love? Surely raising a concern, that's going to make things awkward, right? Should I just keep it to myself? None of my business? See if it gets better on its own? No. So as we've said today, it's our business. In fact, we're commissioned by God to be right in our relationships and be active and intentional in our care and our pursuit of justice. So this may well look like raising a safeguarding concern. The Bible is quite clear that this stuff is hard and in a worldly sense this stuff is costly and it's hard and yes, you may feel awkward. But the Bible also reassures us that in a kingdom sense we are told, blessed are those who fight for justice and blessed are those who thirst for righteousness. And where would you send people if they want to know more? You've talked about righteousness and justice as about being kind of core themes in the Bible. If that's fairly new to us, if we want to dig deeper on that, where can people go to find out more information? There is a great video that the Bible Project have on justice. So I'd give that a Google and have a watch of that. But then my other encouragement is really just when you're opening your Bibles, when you are reading those passages, just keep in the back of your mind like where is God's vision for justice in this? Because it's everywhere. Okay, is there anything else that you'd like to share with us before we wrap up? Anything you'd like to share before we wrap up? I think just to kind of what we said earlier, safeguarding is really rooted in that kingdom vision for the world, for our community, for Gloucester Vineyard Church. And that in creating communities of hope and joy, we need to be rooted in safety. So it's imperative that we are creating a safe space here for all of us in all of our vulnerabilities, in all of our worldly brokenness, so that we can cultivate that culture of deep care for each other. Brilliant. Let's say thanks to Carrie again. Wasn't that amazing? Thank you. Thank you."

    "transcript": "Smashing. Okay. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. So my name is Daniel, along with my wife Emily. I'm one of the senior pastors of this church. It's fabulous to see you all this afternoon. Who wants to see some pictures of my dog? Yay! Let's look at some pictures. So here we go. Here's Ralph. This is my dog Ralph. Isn't he cute? This is him asleep. This is his favourite posture. This is him scratching the paintwork on the side of my car. Thanks, Ralph. More pictures of him when he was a puppy. Isn't he cute? Never quite that cute again. Here he is. This is him now. He's very fast. Lovely. Dog fans in the room? Dog people? Cat people? Oh, change your minds. Goodness sake. Here he is. Look at him. He's so cute. Look at his nose. I'm just going to skip ahead a little bit because there's just more of the same. There we go. There's Ralph. I'm going to leave him up there because he's very sweet. So that's my dog. He's lovely. He's very gentle. He's very easy. He's very sleepy. Now they do say that a dog is a man's best friend. Can I just make it very clear that this dog is not my best friend? There are some days when I don't even like this dog at all. He is a massive pain in the neck. Before we got Ralph, we did some research into what kind of dog we would like to get. We found that Whippets... Ralph is kind of Whippet plus. There's Whippet plus some more in there. But Whippets in generally, they've got lots of the characteristics that we're looking for in a dog. So they don't shed much. They don't smell much. They don't bark much. They don't eat much. Generally speaking, very easy dogs that make great companions. But there was one thing on the website when we were looking and doing our research that Emily and I chose to ignore. And now we regret. On the website it said, Whippets are very willful. Whippets are very willful. So they basically, they're very, very difficult to train. Because if they don't want to do something, they're not going to be doing it. So for example, if we go to the park and Ralph decides that he wants to go over there and eat another dog's business, he was going to go and do that. And there's just nothing I can do about it. Or if he wants to go and introduce himself very enthusiastically to another small fluffy defenseless dog, he is going to go and do that. And no amount of shouting or cajoling from me is going to get him back again. So my experience of owning a dog, as lovely as this one is, is that when our wills are aligned, when what he wants is what I want, we have a great time. When he wants to have a cuddle on the sofa, when we want to play, there's just nothing like having a dog. But in those moments, and other dog owners will testify, when my will and Ralph's will are opposed, it's not fun for any of us. Any other dog owners in the room? Are we agreeing? Yes, it is the worst. And that has got me thinking a little bit about how we relate to God. Because wherever we are on our journey of faith, if we've been following him forever, or if we're still making up our minds, we will all have moments where we will find our will and God's will misaligned. Maybe we've been reading our Bibles, maybe we've been going to home group, coming along to church, maybe we've bumped into some Christian content on TikTok, or we've been listening to some podcasts, or spending quality time with Jesus, talking to a wise friend. Whatever it is, we suddenly find ourselves convicted that there's something about my life, there's something about what I want, that is somehow at odds with what God wants. And somehow, our wills are misaligned. Maybe it's something about being drawn out of our comfort zone, maybe it's kind of being convicted about being kind to that person I really dislike. Maybe it's simply being asked to wait for something that is good to happen. In those moments, we've got a choice, haven't we? We can ignore that very uncomfortable convicting feeling, or we can just crack on and spend some time thinking about it. How many of us know that when we ignore those convicting feelings, they just get bigger and bigger? Anybody ever has that experience? Yes! Thank goodness I'm not alone. So just like my relationship with Ralph, just like my relationship with the dog, it's true that when my will and God's will are aligned, it's the best thing in the world. There's just nothing like it. But when I know that for some reason my will and God's will are out of alignment, it makes our relationship really tricky. Now this is something which happens all the time to followers of Jesus. It's not uncommon or unusual at all to find ourselves in a moment when we're aware that our wills are misaligned. Does anybody here know what I'm talking about? Anybody have this experience? Put your hand up if you had. Seen some nods? Yeah, okay, so generally speaking, kind of, there's some agreement in the room. Or it might be that this dynamic is actually the very thing that's standing in the way of us crossing the line and saying a big yes to Jesus and becoming a Christian in the first place. It might be that we actually sense that saying yes to Jesus would mean bringing some of the things in our life into line with how God looks at the world and how God thinks our lives should run and the way we live them. That in order to follow Jesus with total integrity, some of the things in my life might have to change. Now that is totally natural and normal and an honest place to find ourselves. This experience is a continuous characteristic of following Jesus. We should expect to be in this place all the time. There was this famous German theologian during the Second World War called Dietrich Bonhoeffer. And he said this, we must be ready to allow ourselves to be interrupted by God. God will be constantly crossing our paths and cancelling our plans. One of my favourite psalms ever, it ends with this really scary moment of prayer, Psalm 139. And the scary moment of prayer says this, search me, O God, and know my heart. Test me and know my anxious thoughts. This is the scary bit. Point out anything in me that offends you and lead me along the path of everlasting life. How many of us know that God loves to answer that prayer? Guys, this is what it means to give our lives to Jesus. This is what it means to be a follower of Jesus, to call ourselves a Christian. We should be having this experience all the time. Because if we're living a life where what I want and what God wants is always perfectly aligned, if we're never having the experience of finding ourselves out of alignment with him, we're either like unicorn level follower of Jesus and you should really be up here preaching, or can I suggest that maybe we're not allowing God to speak into our lives at all? May I be so bold to say that if we're going through life and there are no areas of our thought life, none of our actions, nothing about how we spend our time, our energy, our money, nothing about how we express ourselves sexually or how we speak to others that is coming into conflict with how God would have us conduct ourselves in those spaces, may I be so bold as to say that maybe we haven't given our lives to Jesus? Or we're actually not necessarily following him? Or maybe we haven't submitted ourselves in any meaningful way to him? Let me give you a small, medium and large example and then I'd love to hear from some examples from you. So for me, every single day I wake up, hallelujah, and I don't want to get out of bed. And it might be that God wants to spend a bit of time with me before I start the day, but I don't want to get out of bed. So our wills are just a little bit misaligned. Or let me give you another one. Maybe I make a new friend and one of the first things this new friend says to me is that their shoulder hurts today. It might be that God wants me to pray for that person to be healed. But I've just made this friend. I don't want them to think I'm really weird. I want to make a good first impression. I'm like, the weirdness can come later. Like, our wills are misaligned, right? Anybody ever been in that situation? Or maybe I'm faced with the opportunity to live with and sleep with my partner before we're married. Now, it might be that we become aware that God might actually want us to wait for marriage before we cross that line. But that's not what I want, for like a million reasons. Like, our wills are misaligned. So I've given you three little examples. What I want you guys to do now is to break into little groups with those people around you and just have a little discussion. Can you think of any ideas, any other examples of times when our wills, common examples when our wills and God's will might be different from one another? They can be big or little. They can be silly or sensible. I'd love to hear your feedback afterwards. So get into those little groups and just for a couple of minutes have a little discussion and then I'm going to ask for some feedback. Okay, you ready? On your marks, get set, go. Okay, let's hear some of your examples. So have you guys got anything to say? Yes, youth home group. Praise silence for the youth home group. Here comes some wisdom. So a moment where our wills and God's will might be a little bit misaligned. Similar to one of yours where you have a friend or you've just made a new friend and you want to\n\nYou have anyone else get the impression that God's like, hi, I'm over here. And we're like, just give me a minute. Give me a minute. That's a really interesting reel. Have you remembered? Yeah. So the other thing is, I quite often, especially when I'm like with my other friends from, shall we say, the other side of things, it's difficult to explain. But basically, I have a lot of friends who definitely don't really know Christianity as well. Some of them are highly skeptical of it and everything else. And sometimes it's difficult, isn't it, to sort of like balance how do you do the right Christian thing without really cheesing off people that aren't remotely interested? Yeah, so when you're kind of hanging around with your other friends and there's other forces and other voices in the room, it's very difficult, isn't it? Okay, guys, thank you. Appreciate that. Okay. Where am I on this? Here, great. So the question I want to ask today is, thank you, Chez, by the way, for doing that. What should we do, doom scrolling, what should we do in these moments? What should our response be when we find ourselves in this place? Because as I've said, this is an essential, ordinary, natural, and built-in part of what it means to be a follower of Jesus. The reality is that this is both the way in and the way on in the kingdom of God. But I also wanted to talk about this today because as a church, we are going to be launching a new expression of this church in the north of the city early next year. And whilst that's a very good and exciting thing, the reality is that doing that step, kind of making that step is going to come at a cost. And whenever there's any kind of a cost to pay, whether it's buying crisps at the supermarket or buying your house, the thought runs through my head of, do I really want to pay that cost? That's going to cost me personally. And so these moments are either motivated by big, exciting news or simply as part of our day-to-day walk with Jesus, and moments when our wills and His will can be misaligned. They are uncomfortable moments and difficult moments. They can be moments when our relationship feel like they're under strain. And I think how we respond in those moments is really, really important. Because I believe that those moments are actually opportunities when we can become most fully alive. Those are the moments when we can actually step into our full humanity in an amazing way. And so today, with whatever time we've got left before the kids come rampaging back in again, I want to just take us on a little journey. We're going to read a couple of stories. We're going to get a little bit theological, a little bit philosophical, and hopefully we're going to end up really practical. How does that sound? Great. There's a couple of mmm's in the room. We like those. So the first thing I want to observe today is something that, frankly, I find totally bonkers. And I don't know if I'm ever really going to get my head around it. And to get there, I just want to ask a really quick question. Thinking about the world around us, everything that we see in the headlines, everything that we see in the world right now, here's my question. Do we see God's will being done in the world? Thinking about everything that goes on, do we see God's will being done in the world? All of the stuff right now? I think I would agree. And if we could put a percentage on it, what percentage would we say is like God's will on earth and what percentage is? 10, 20? Yeah, I'm with you, Paul. I really am. What about you guys? And so I'm just going to kind of go over here. Does anybody here think that 100% of what happens in the world today is the way that God would have it? That's a relief because that would have been a see-me-after-class moment and we would have had a conversation. That would have been fun, wouldn't it? What about like 90%, 80%? Shove your hand up when we're there. 70, 60, 50. Oh, we've got some 50s. Okay, yeah. 40, 30, 20, 10, 0. Nobody's zero, but there was a handful of 10s. Okay, let's just make it just slightly more personal for a second. Don't worry, I'm not going to ask you to raise a hand. But just have a little bit of a think. In our personal lives, what percentage of our lives would we say are in line with the way that God wants us to live our lives? I said don't say anything. Thank you. Although I appreciate it, thank you. Just take a little minute to think. What percentage of our lives, the thing that we have the most control over, would we say is in line with the way that God would have us live them? I'm going to take an educated guess here and say that none of us are peaking at 100. I mean, Paul is 80, 90 over here. So if you are, come and talk to Paul because he's near where you are. For me, I would definitely be like sub 50%. And that's not just me being overcritical. Whilst we're in this moment of self-reflection, why don't we just try to identify at least one way that this dynamic of being out of sync, misaligned with God's will, is playing out in our lives right now. Again, I'm not going to ask you for feedback, but just in this moment of self-reflection, let's just think. Can you think of a way right now that you're feeling convicted that maybe one of the ways I'm thinking, one of the ways I'm acting, something about our relationship, we're just out of alignment. Just take literally 10 seconds to think. Okay. So I'm sure that we can agree that to a great extent, we are living in a world which is outside of God's will. Things are not 100% the way that God would have them. Even when we think about our lives, the things over which we have the most control, we've just mentally admitted that none of us would say our lives are 100% in line with how God would have us live them. And this isn't a moment to beat ourselves up or give ourselves a hard time. It's just to observe that this is clearly the case. And this is the thing that I find completely bonkers. It's that we live in a world that God has created where he says to us as humanity, may your will be done on earth. Bear with me. I am going to unpack that. We live in a world that God has created where he says, may your will be done on earth. Look at the world around us. Look at our lives. We are living in the consequences of what happens when our will is allowed to be done on earth. It is extraordinary but true. God has given us an amazing world to live in. He's asked us to rule it. And he set it up in such a way that we as humans, we have real agency. We can make real decisions which have real consequences and real impacts. You know, God could have set things up completely differently. We could be pre-programmed robots where every action and decision is predetermined. That's clearly not the case. We could be his puppets where he kind of controls our every move in real time. That is clearly not the case either. No, God in his amazing and bonkers generosity has set things up in such a way that we have a genuine choice. We have a will and we get to express that will in our lives and on the earth. And we get to see our actions and our choices play out. Ron, can I give you that? It's gone dead on me. And I think it just needs to be unlocked. Sorry, thank you. Failure of multitasking. That didn't work. We see this extraordinary dynamic established in the opening pages of our Bible. Thank you, my friend. We meet two characters, Adam and Eve. They're set up in a beautiful garden. They're given everything they could ever need. And they're given a will. They're given the choice and the opportunity to express their will in the world. Let's have a read, shall we? So we're in the opening chapters of our Bibles and we read this wonderful narrative about how God created the world where humans can live and thrive. How God made everything up there and everything down here. Everything visible and everything invisible. Everything physical and spiritual. And what God immediately does for humanity is he gives them a job. And then he gives them a choice. He gives them a purpose and then he gives them a will. So we read this in the opening pages of our Bibles. Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and govern it. Reign over the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and all the animals that scurry along the ground. So that's our job description. Go everywhere and rule the earth on God's behalf. Sweet. But then God gives them a choice because governing the world on God's behalf is going to be tricky. We're going to need some help with that. We're going to need some knowledge. We're going to need some wisdom. We're going to need some sense of good and bad, some sense of right and wrong. We're going to need to get that framework from somewhere. And so God then presents humanity with a choice. He presents them with their will. And we read this. This multitasking thing is a bad idea. I apologize. I shouldn't have done this. We read this. The Lord God placed the man in the Garden of Eden. Yeah, thanks, Ron. I appreciate you. To tend and watch over it. But the Lord God warned him, you may freely eat the fruit of every tree in the\n\nWell, you're going to need knowledge, you're going to need wisdom, you're going to need a sense of good and bad, right and wrong. He's basically saying, how are you going to get the wisdom and the understanding to know how to do the things that I've asked you to do? Are you going to do it alongside me, the way I've designed it, in a loving relationship? Or are you going to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and bad? I.e., are you going to make those decisions for yourself outside of our loving relationship with me? This is the first classic moment of God's will and our will coming into conflict. This is the very first time where we see that bonkers dynamic that I talked about earlier on coming into play. God has passed over the authority of managing this world to us humans and said, whatever you decide, it will be done. He has said to us, may your will be done on earth. This isn't to say that God isn't involved in the ongoing running of the world or that he never intervenes. I'm not saying that at all, but we can clearly see that this is the way that our world works, can't we? If we want to create a world driven by greed, where we scourge the planet and the environment in order to make a profit, then clearly we have the will to do that. If we want to create societies where men are dominant over women and women are treated like objects of property, we clearly have the ability and the will to do that. If we want to create a world where people's value is defined by the color of their skin or their geographic location where they were born, we clearly have the ability to do that. May our wills be done. As bonkers as it is to admit, God has given us a world in which he repeatedly says to us, may your will be done on earth. And just look at what we've done with the place. We are all living in the consequences of humanity misusing the generous gift that God has given us. We see it writ large in our world and the politics around us on the news, and we see it writ small in our lives where we find ourselves able to self-sabotage, throw our lives away and do stupid things, make stupid decisions and squander our own happiness and our futures. May our wills be done in our lives and in the world. So I want to take a really quick, this is a really depressing moment, isn't it? I'm really sorry. Don't worry, we're going to go like this. It's going to be fine. Let's just take another really quick moment of discussion with those around you. I'm not structured at all, but I just want to give you a moment to respond. Pause and reflect. Maybe you agree with something I've just said. Maybe you disagree with something I've just said. Maybe you're smart and you want to add some nuance to something I've just said. This is a moment to do that. So I'm just going to give you one minute to just kind of brain dump with those around you, and then we're going to come back and hopefully go like this. Okay, you ready? Go. Okay. So what do we do? Where do we go from here? When we look around, we can see that God has given us an extraordinary gift of a beautiful world to live in, that he's granted us the dignity of a will to decide where we're going to go with it. But we've also somewhat painfully highlighted that when we relentlessly pursue what we want in the world, when we define good and evil for ourselves, when we find ourselves stood at the tree with a choice of following God's wisdom or choosing our own way, when we find our wills misaligned, and when what we want is not what God wants, when we find ourselves in that place and we choose our will, things often end in a mess. If we're honest and we do a little bit of a life audit, it doesn't take us long to think of examples of times when we've gone our own way and we've made a bit of a mess. Moments of regret when we wish we'd come into alignment with God's will for our lives sooner. Personally, just like my friend Chris shared earlier on, part of my journey has been about battling addiction. And one of the things that I've learned is that the longer I stay in what I want, the harder it is to move myself into what God wants for me. I also mentioned earlier about the idea of God wanting us to wait until we're married to live with and sleep with each other as a powerful witness to the world about the power and beauty of sex and the kind of prophetic significance of marriage. That was a big part of my journey and Emily's journey too. When Em and I were dating, we were dating and engaged for a really long time before we eventually got married and moved in together. And believe me, we wanted to, you know, get on with it. It was extremely difficult to align our wills to God's in that moment. And there were plenty of moments when we messed up and just pursued what we wanted. Like, I get it. And just look at the board that I accidentally just got rid of. Look at it anyway. It's over there. Those are the things that we've identified as areas where we experience this misalignment of will. So what do we do? How do we respond when we find ourselves in that moment? When we become convinced that actually when we always get what we want, it's not necessarily the best for us or the world. What do we do? Well, I want to go back into our Bibles and look at another man. We're going to visit another garden. And we find this man standing next to another tree and again being confronted with a battle of wills, being confronted with what God wants for his life and for the world and what he and his humanity wants. And what we see in this moment, rather than what Adam did, which was to choose his will, this guy surrenders his will and says, not my will, but yours be done. We observe this scene in the garden with a man who's confronted with a hugely painful moment of his will and God's will being misaligned. This guy, he is so anguished with the clash of wills that he's experienced that he says, my soul is crushed with grief to the point of death. And he goes on to say, if it's possible, let this choice be taken away from me. Let this cup of suffering be taken away from me. In other words, if there's another way that we can do this, please, can we do it that way? He's saying, I cannot face what you're asking me to do. He goes on and prays through the night and eventually he reaches a place in his prayers where his prayer shifts and he prays, if this cup cannot be taken away unless I drink it, then your will be done. In a moment of extraordinary humility and honesty, he says, if there's no other way for this to be done, then I choose your way and not my way. Did you catch the way he said it? He said, may your will be done. Earlier on he said it too. He said, I want your will to be done, not mine. Clearly this is that moment that we've been looking at today. This is the moment where my will and God's will are not aligned. The moment where something's got to give. The moment where I've been given a choice. I can walk away, I can walk my way, or I can choose to walk God's way. And this is perhaps the most epic clash of wills in the history of the universe because the person in this garden is Jesus. The person who's praying those prayers is Jesus. The person saying, I want your will to be done, not mine, is Jesus. In this moment we see Jesus as our brother. We see him as one of us, as fully human, as a human being just like you and me. When faced with difficult things, when faced with costly things, he has a real and honest and human reaction. We are allowed, we are permitted that glimpse of Jesus in weakness, where he says what we say. He says, God, I know what you want, but I don't want that. It's an astounding moment of authenticity that we're allowed to witness here. This is Jesus the human. This is Jesus our brother. And yet on the heels of this moment of vulnerability and authenticity, of this moment of almost pure humanity, Jesus shows us what it means to be truly human. He shows us what it means to be truly alive. Jesus demonstrates for us what it means to be human when he turns to the Father and says seven words, not my will, but yours be done. Not my will, but yours be done. And let's just remind ourselves quickly what was going on here. Let's remind ourselves of what Jesus was being asked to do because he wasn't being asked to just kind of give a bit of money to the undies fund. He wasn't being asked to risk his reputation by going and praying for that person. He wasn't being asked to speak with more compassion towards that person that he dislikes. He was being asked to go to the cross. He was being asked to be arrested, beaten, mocked, tortured and crucified, to be killed as a criminal, to be abandoned by his friends. But more than that, he knew that the path ahead of him would lead beyond death into the depths of hell itself to deliver a death blow to death. He was being asked to somehow have an experience of being abandoned by God, to experience separation from the Father for the first time. And yet in the face of that cost, Jesus, our brother and our example said, not my will, but yours be done. Some of us might have been raised to know the Lord's Prayer. We might remember this little phrase. It finds its way in there, doesn't it? This prayer, Jesus would have expected us to pray this daily. It says, our Father in heaven, may your name\n\nmotivated by love and generosity says to us, may your will be done on earth. And where we, motivated by love and gratitude, are invited to reply, no, not my will, but yours be done. To find ourselves in that reciprocal dance with our creator is to know what it is to be fully human. It's to find ourselves back in the garden at the tree and to choose a relationship with him over going our own way. To be a follower of Jesus is to pray each day, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth and in my life as it is in heaven. And to take that board of stuff that we identified earlier on and to say, no, Lord, not my will, but yours be done. Amen."

    "transcript": "in the name of God who is Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Amen. Please be seated. So today is Harvest Festival Sunday when we celebrate the harvest. And I was thinking this week that God has provided for us so much. There is so much to be thankful for. And this week in my prayers I've been thanking God for Greggs. I love a Greggs, especially a steak bake. It's brilliant. I had to travel a lot to my theological college in Oxford, training to be a vicar. And I used to stop off at Cheveley Service Station on the M4. And guess what? There was a Greggs provided for me. It was brilliant. There were so many times during my years of training that I thought, oh, not another weekend away. But just the thought, just the thought of that steak bake was all the incentive I needed to keep going. You see, if we're to understand our passage in our gospel, we have to understand the context. And this is one of the best ways I have found to understand scripture. You see, if you read the whole of chapter six of John's gospel, it actually starts off with the story of the feeding of the 5,000. And it is one of only four miracles that are found in all four of the gospels. Which today must show us the importance of why that story is so relevant. So I want you to picture the scene that you're in the time of Israel. You have just returned from the eastern side of Lake Galilee. And you are wondering, like, where Jesus is. You've just seen this enormous miracle of 5,000 men, it says in scripture, who were fed from a boy's packed lunch. It's insane. It's impossible. But you've seen it with your own eyes. In fact, I believe there were more than 5,000 people. Because it says, if you read in John, that there were 5,000 men. So there must have been loads of women and children as well. So we come to the setting of our passage this morning. You're in this town called Capernaum. You've traveled there with a huge crowd. You've found where Jesus is. And you think, right, this is it. We found someone who can provide for my physical needs. We've got someone who's going to overthrow the Romans. It's all going to be sorted. So our passage this morning is part of a longer discourse that Jesus says in the synagogue, the religious place in Capernaum. And it wouldn't have been all different to what we do here on a Sunday. There would have been some verses of scripture. There would have been some songs of praise. There would have been a collection for the running of the synagogue. The only difference is that the women and men would have been separated. Now, I'm not suggesting we try and do that now. But the point is that Jesus was preaching this in a religious building like this morning. But I've always believed that for you to understand about who Jesus was, we've got to understand a bit more about the Old Testament. And in our reading from the book of Deuteronomy, it's all about the story of Moses. And you can imagine that Moses was out in the desert. He's retired, probably in his 80s, and he's got over a million Israelites, according to scholars. And you think, my goodness me, Moses was out there. There was no Domino's. There's no Burger King. There's no Tesco meal deal to be had. He had to totally rely on God for manna from heaven. And so many people ask me today, they say, well, I don't really believe in God. Give us a sign, or I want to see that Jesus is real. Then I'll believe. It says in Psalm 14, the fool in his heart says there is no God. God is showing through the story of the feeding of the 5,000 and through the story of Moses that God does provide for our physical needs. And we're always very quick to ask for our physical needs in our prayers, a bit like me thanking God for a steak bake. But if you want to understand wisdom and you want to understand about God, then I would employ you to start reading something like Proverbs in the Bible, because it's where you get fantastic wisdom. But you can imagine those people sitting in the synagogue thinking, oh, this doesn't make any sense. Jesus, I'm sure you'll come in here and you want to overthrow everything and we're going to make you king by force. And surely that's the answer to our problems. What's all this about the bread of life? That's not what I've come all the way here for. Jesus understood and knew that they were under persecution. He was living through it. He understood what it was like to have the pressures. And the same way Jesus today understands what it's like for us under the pressures of modern life. It's a bit like being at work, isn't it? When you think, I can't deal with another email. I can't deal with another WhatsApp message from a needy friend. I've got so much that's overwhelming me and I don't know what to do. But our passage in John's gospel is about one of the most famous in the Bible, where Jesus states, I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. Jesus is saying to the audience and is saying to us today, I can give you a fulfilled life. It's about having a total reliance on God daily. It's about believing that the power of the Holy Spirit can come into your life and it can change you. And the truth is the Holy Spirit stirs us. It makes us think about things differently. And many people I meet want to see miracles happen, but they don't want to change themselves. Yeah, I'll hear about God. That's great. I want to hear about God. As long as I don't have to change anything. Now I'm not saying God does not care about our physical needs because he does. And the reason why I know that is because it's in the Lord's Prayer. It says, give us today our daily bread. However, if we're only focused on our physical needs, we are missing the point of what Jesus is trying to tell us. Jesus is saying, I can give you a life in the Spirit which is more fulfilled than the physical one. But what we sometimes find is that a lot of us, and me included, we always try to live our spiritual life just on a Sunday only. And there were many people that I asked that say, you know, are you Church of England? So yeah, I'm C of E, yeah. Why are you C Andy, Christmas and Easter? You see, in our life we have three gauges. It's like sitting in a car. But we have a physical gauge, a mental gauge, and a spiritual gauge. And the spiritual is the hardest one to keep filled, as I truly believe we are in spiritual warfare. And that's why it's so important about Holy Communion. It's why we have it here most Sundays. Because what we're acknowledging is that Jesus was fully human and he was fully God. And the most amazing thing about Christianity is that he is alive. And sometimes we will pray a lot and God does not seem to answer. But sometimes when we're praying for something, God will always answer it in a very different way. And I had a lot of respect for my gran. And my gran was a very, very religious woman. And gosh, her prayers were powerful. I was going through the operator. She had the direct line, you know what I mean? If you ask my gran to pray, it got answered. And I can remember sitting with my gran. My grandparents were farmers. And I can remember sitting in the farmhouse as a teenager. I said, gran, I just don't believe that I'm ever going to find anyone to marry. This just ain't going to happen. It's not going to happen. It's all right, I'll pay for God to give me something else. That's fine, I get that. And my gran said, Thomas, I'm going to pray for you to find a wife. But we're going to pray that you find someone who lives south of Watford. And I said to my gran, I said, what is it about south of Watford that I'm going to find a wife? And she said, no, no, I just believe that we're meant to pray for that. Now, if those of you get a chance to meet Roxanne, she'll find she's from South Africa, which is about as far south of Watford as it's possibly to get. And the amazing thing is that my gran died four years before she met Roxanne. Her prayers were answered, but she never got to see it in this life. But I truly believe that she is in paradise and she could see her prayers being answered. The message of this is never underestimate a gran who prays, ever. But I'd encourage you to seek on in prayer. And sometimes it feels like you're not getting\n\nanywhere and you just think, oh, this just isn't happening. But Jesus promises us in our scriptures that I will give you life. I truly believe that God gives you life in abundance. In the same way, strangely, I was in Aldi the other day and I noticed just the sheer variety of bread options. It's like a whole aisle. Jesus wants to give us abundance in our life. But what connects our story most of all, the story between Moses and the story of the feeding of the 5,000, is do you know what? There was so much left over. And you can read about in the story of Moses about how God provided manna every single day and there was just loads left over. You read the story of the feeding of the 5,000, they'd fill up 12 whole baskets. It's insanely the amount that God will bless us. It's more than we could possibly need. I truly believe this morning that Jesus is inviting us to share in a spiritual life. All we have to do is say yes. Amen."

    "transcript": "And so this is the first Sunday of the month. So today, today is Super Sunday. It's so exciting. What the heck is a Super Sunday? A Super Sunday is the moment when we pause our usual rhythms of opening the Bible together and singing songs in order to go out and love and serve our neighbours in practical ways. It's our way of learning about God's heart for those people who are outside of our church. So that's what we generally do every Super Sunday. But at the moment we're in the middle of adding a little extra sauce to these moments of serving. Because as a church we are preparing to launch another expression of this church in the north of the city next year. And so we are using these gatherings as a moment to dig deeper, to do some training, to do some equipping and getting ready for this exciting moment of multiplication. Hooray! And so just to let you know what we're going to do today. Actually I'll tell you that in a minute. Some practical things first. If you want a cup of tea or coffee they're all at the back. Help yourself at any time. If you need the toilet they're just through there and on the left. And that's a fire escape and that's a fire escape. We're not expecting a fire but if there is one head for one of those places. But why are we doing this today? Why are we doing this? Why are we not doing what every other church in the city has done today? Why do we shake things up once a month? There's a whole load of reasons why but one of the reasons that's been really on my mind recently is because as a community of Jesus we are called to be witnesses to the way of Jesus and the kingdom of God and the way that Jesus has changed our lives. We are called to be witnesses. And I've had that little word witness running through my head in the last few weeks because some of us might be aware there was a very high profile assassination recently in the news. A guy called Charlie Kirk was murdered over in the States which was very attention grabbing and a lot of social media, at least my social media, was talking about Charlie as a martyr. Anybody else hear that? That word martyr? So that word was getting knocked around social media which kind of caught my attention as you can imagine. Now that word martyr in English has a very specific meaning. It means somebody who dies for their faith. Somebody who dies for a cause. But the word martyr is actually a Bible word. It comes directly out of our Bibles. And it doesn't mean somebody who dies for a cause. What it means is somebody who stands up for what is true and is a witness to the truth. So somebody who speaks about and demonstrates what they've found to be true. And we find this word martyr all throughout one of the books of the Bible called Acts. And our Bibles translate this word as witness. Jesus says, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you and you will be my witnesses, my martyrs, telling people about me everywhere you go. So we are all, if we identify as followers of Jesus, called to be martyrs, called to be witnesses. We're all called to be witnesses for Jesus, showing and telling the good news of the kingdom of God here today. And so that is what today is all about. That is why we do Super Sundays. It's about showing and demonstrating God's love in practical, servant-hearted ways to our city. I'm personally pleased that today, when there's been people out on the streets of this fair city who have been protesting the presence of asylum seekers in our city, that today we are also going to be hitting the streets in a posture to serve and love and to care and to demonstrate a heavenly kingdom where love, generosity and self-sacrifice are the guiding principles. Amen? Two-minute preach. Look at that. Sorry, just had that one on my heart. There we go. And so today we are going to be demonstrating God's love. We're going to be serving in a handful of ways. There are three things that we're going to do today. Smashing. Okay, I'm going to use this, not because it's necessary, but because we're recording this, obviously, so folks can listen in afterwards. So I'm also going to pass it to you guys if you have got a question. So do be brave and use the microphone. Thanks for coming and hopefully coming with some questions. We're going to do our best to respond to those questions. If we have, hopefully we have something close to an approximation of an answer, we will certainly try to give a response. But don't be at all surprised if we say something like, I don't know. That's a really good question. I'm not quite sure. And so, yes, I wanted to just say a couple of things before we dive straight in. We've thought of a few things to say in case you guys literally have nothing to ask, but I imagine that's not the case. A couple of things to say. An encouragement to please ask all of your questions. If you have a list, that's fine. You may bring all of them. Don't be shy. Please ask silly questions as well. You might be thinking, this seems trivial, this seems silly. Please don't think that. If you've thought of it, there's a good chance that somebody else has thought of it. So you vocalizing it will be helpful for someone else. Please ask awkward questions. Don't not ask a question because you think it might make us feel uncomfortable. We're quite able to defend ourselves. And so if we feel like a question is impertinent, we will say, I have literally no idea. We'll say that's absolutely none of your business, but thanks for asking the question. But honestly, please ask any difficult, awkward questions that you have. But, you know, obviously forgive us if we end up saying, I have absolutely no idea. And also, this would be a great moment to share any ideas and suggestions that you might have. Because so far we've had a number of brains on this idea and on this project. But we all have the Holy Spirit within us. The Holy Spirit speaks through each of us. And so it might well be that you can bring some insight today on something that we have not thought about or to an issue that we're struggling with. So if you've got some ideas, please put your hand up, grab the microphone. We'd love to hear from you. This is one of the joys about kind of going public with this idea is that we get to be collaborative. We get to work together. And now this is something that we are all doing together. Anything you want to add? Nope. Great. Anybody got, who wants to ask a question? There's one on the board. Oh, should we tackle the one on the board? So the question on the board is, will it have a kids' church? Which is a really great question. And I think the short answer to that is yes, kind of. So what we are trying to do is set things up in the north in such a way that on the first Sunday, if there are some young families that join us, we are ready for that eventuality. So what that will probably look like is Heather and one other will be ready at the morning gathering with some activities for the small kids. They will take the kids out and they will do the activity with the kids and bring them back in again. So there will be some form of kids' church, but it won't look like the kind of all singing, all dancing kids' church that we have here in the afternoon. I think one of the things that we would like to encourage folks is that if your kids are currently invested in kids' church, then it would be great for them to remain invested in kids' church. They're very welcome in the center. Because in the north, there will just be fewer kids initially, and we just don't know what that's going to look like. So if your kids are invested there, then great. When we started this church, it looked like having for some younger kiddos, having play mats and stuff at the back so there's a space for parents with small, non-kids aged children, and we'll probably do something similar as well. We'll accommodate a bit for the kids that are there, and then we'll grow as the kids grow, and we will flex according to that. Yes. What venue were you thinking of? Good question, thank you. So we have been, we've kind of been cryptically saying north of Gloucester, but we're kind of looking at kind of Churchdown, Innsworth, Longford, down Hatherley type neighborhoods. And we have been looking at venues for the last couple of months, and we are having an interesting experience of that. So our friends from Cardiff Vineyard, one of the pieces of advice that they gave us was that actually securing a venue is a really important thing to get kind of in place. And that was a surprise to me. I thought it would be get your teams in place, train everybody up, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, get your trustees, get your budgets. Yes, that is very important, but they basically said as soon as you can get a venue, secure, do it. Because what they've done in the past, and where they've, I think they have four sites now, and what they found in the past is they've been completely ready to go, everything ready, but they've got no venue. And when they've gone to the places that they assumed would say yes to them, everyone said no. And they've had a big problem. And so we've been to a handful of venues, and we've been just at the moment of inquiring about how much does it cost, can we get it booked? And they've said, oh, I'm sorry, somebody's just jumped in ahead of you and booked it now. And so we don't currently have a venue. We had a couple that we were really focused on and really quite excited about. But so far, just as\n\nI have a double question. The first one is, how do you guys feel like you're going to allocate your time for both churches? Will you guys be visiting both? And also what time will the second service be? And then the next question is, what mistakes did you make the first time in trying to get people in this church that you won't make the second time to make sure that when you publicize, there will be people in there? And then also, how can we help as a community to get that word out? Such great questions. So first question was, how will we be splitting our time or allocating our time? And the answer is, Daniel and I, us two individuals, we will be at everything all the time, pretty much. So we will lead the team in the north for the time being until we are able to appoint site pastors who will lead the team on our behalf, as Chaz and Don will be doing in the centre. But we are very much going to be here in the afternoons serving on teams, preaching, leading worship, all of that as well. We're not expecting our kids to do both, just in case anyone's concerned about our kids, but we are. And so our kids will be coming here in the afternoon. And the morning will probably be the holy time of 10.30, likely, but TBC, unknown. Yeah. Yeah, so one of the things that we as a family are going to be doing is that we are, because obviously that's a very long day on a Sunday, and so a lot of people have kind of gone, you can't do double church Sunday. And my response to that is, I think you can, as long as you accommodate it in the rest of your boundaries. So one of the things that we're going to be doing and one of the ways that we're budgeting is that Emily and I will basically have Fridays and Saturdays off every week. And so Sundays, yes, will be a very busy day for us. But I also like to encourage folks to remember that as much as this is our passion and our love and our vocation, it is also our jobs. And all of you guys know what it's like to have a busy day at work. Sometimes there's one day of the week that is particularly busy. And so for us, that will be a busy day at work. Is that fair to say? Yeah, I think so. When we have appointed site pastors north and site pastors central, we will be overseeing both. And so that may look slightly different then, but we anticipate being most of the time at both places. The next question was, what mistakes did you make first time that you're not going to make second time? Well, I was going to say, I can't promise we're not going to make them again because we're human. So we endeavor to learn lessons from our mistakes, but also from everyone else's mistakes. We love learning the lessons. I'm going to pause for a minute because nothing is immediately springing to mind, but I'm sure it is for you because that's how your brain is wired. So mistakes that we made the first time that we're going to try not to repeat this time. One of them I would say is, you've got one already, haven't you? When we first started the church, I was very keen, very gung-ho about making the church bigger. I thought as long as the church can be bigger, everything will work. And so we tried to do lots and lots of things to make the church bigger. And we learned pretty quickly that that was a fantastic way of completely wasting your energy. Basically, we learned that it is God who, Jesus grows the church, that he sends people, the right people at the right time when we're ready for them. And really, all of our efforts trying to just put bums on seats was just wearing us out. And not the point. And not the point, just not the point. And so one of the lessons that I hope we've learned is to say, thank you, Jesus, for the people who are currently in the room. And Jesus, when we're ready, we trust that you will send any more that you would like to. So one of the things that we will not be doing is trying to force anything and make sure that there's more people in the room than there needs to be. Another thing is we're better at communication now than we used to be. Things are a bit slower. Things are a bit more thorough now. In the early days of planting church, it looked very different. So circumstances that were presented to us seven or eight years ago would look very different if the same thing presented itself now, simply because it was basically just the two of us eight years ago. And now that's just not the case. And so we have opted in for slower, more collaborative, more communicative leadership because we have discovered through mistakes that that is much better. And we make healthier decisions and people are cared for better. Whereas in the early days, we could just be like, text the five people and be like, we're actually changing to 10.30 rather than 10. See you later on Sunday. And that was kind of it. So there's a lot that has morphed and changed out of necessity because we're leading something totally different to what it was seven or eight years ago. But we have learnt from the kind of gung-ho, less communication, speedy decision making. We've learnt that lesson, hopefully, and I'm sure we will learn it again. I think one mistake I think we didn't make, and I'm glad that we didn't make it, and I hope that we don't make it this time, is doing things sustainably based on where we are actually at, not where we feel like we should be. And so one of the things about our Sunday gatherings is that if we didn't have any worship team, we didn't have worship. If we didn't have enough kids team, we didn't have kids. And when we did have enough kids team, it was small based on what we really did have. And so I think what I often see churches doing is kind of stretching people to kind of strive to be somewhere that we're just not and kind of burning people out in the process. I think what I'd rather do is kind of roll with the fact that there's just going to be fewer people in the room, and that just means we can't do everything that we might do here in the centre, but that's okay. So kind of just not pretending to be something that we're not, I think, that's one. It's just reminded me of, we'd just done a whole series personally about eliminating hurry and haste and kind of that kind of anxious presence stuff from our personal lives. And then that Sunday, like our kids were sick and we arrived at church having made all of the coffee at home. And then everything broke. Like we smashed like three coffee jugs in about 20 minutes. And Daniel looked and went, Asda opens at 10, we're meeting in the mornings at this point, Asda opens at 10, it's 5 to 10 now, church starts at half 10. I reckon I could go. And we just went, what are we, no, there's no coffee guys this morning. And so we just went, sorry guys, we smashed all the coffee, there's no coffee this morning. We'll get it for next week. And everyone went, sure. And that was just a moment where we went, oh yeah, that's better. That's a better way of living for everyone. Could you remind me, what was your third question? In terms of publication and getting people in the seats, not to burn you guys out, how can we help as a community to get people down? Yeah, thank you. So we're probably going to kind of start talking about this a lot more publicly in the next few weeks. When we do, it'd be great if you guys could just share that stuff on your social media. But really, I think just thinking about anybody that you might know in the north of the city who might be interested in coming and exploring faith. Very much a priority on people who are not currently part of a church. So what we really don't want to see happening here is that people go, oh, there's a new option open, I'm just going to leave my existing church and come to this new option. We will be trying very hard to kind of turn people around and send them back from whence they came, if that is the case. We're very excited about people kind of being excited about the mission that we're on, about who we are as a community. We're really not about just shuffling the deck of Christians. And so particularly if you are aware of anybody who lives up in the north who might be interested in exploring faith community. I mean, the reality is that as a church, we don't express ourselves that differently to lots of the other churches in the city. But there are a few things which are a bit different and are a bit fresh and are a bit, I hope, innovative and interesting. Like just like the fact that we do this on the first Sunday of every month is just different. And this is refreshing for some people and it is refreshing for their faith. And so we do encounter a lot of people for whom those small differences actually add up to quite a lot. And so if people are exploring faith and looking for a church, it'd be great to encounter them. And I'd say wherever you're based, center or north, be church really well. Just be it really goodly. Like join your home group and commit to it and invite people to it and pray for your friends and pray for your church family and help them move house. And when someone new walks in on a Sunday, welcome them, give them tea, coffee, bring them over to tea and toast. Like that's how it is. Yes, there are like marketing options to get our name out there or whatever. But the reality is this is a community and this is a family. And so the way that\n\nwould we be leaving? As in we would just hand over the centre and go somewhere else? No, absolutely not. So this isn't Daniel and Emily's exit strategy by any stretch. So a couple of years ago we were tired and we were worn out and we were going, okay, what's next? What are we doing? How are we doing this? And we both asked the question independently of God, please can we hand this over because we're tired? And God said to us individually, no. And we went, he said, well, and so it was a genuine moment of going, okay, in which case we need to have a sabbatical in order to come back and lead well and to come back into this next moment of church because we've been in church plant mode for seven years and we're no longer a church plant. We are a stable, existing church and that requires something different from us as leaders and from the community as a whole. And we went, we need to rest up and grow up. And so that's why we chose to have a sabbatical and we were very grateful for that. But no, absolutely not. If we were bigger, we'd probably just have a bigger team launching a new expression or we'd be like, let's, previous Daniel and Emily would be like, we're big enough. Let's just do three plants at the same time, three launches at the same time. Great, we could do that. That's what it, so absolutely not. We are, we love it here. We love GVC. This is our home. So we are sticking around. No, no, no, no. Great question. Yeah, I appreciate the awkward question. Genuinely, thank you. That's very, very awkward. But I echo what Emily said, like for us, this isn't any kind of an exit strategy. I'm personally so excited about just the idea of multi-site church. I just think it's so innovative and interesting and creative and we've seen it be super effective elsewhere and there's elements of it for our church which I think are going to be really kind of supercharged, especially when it comes to the Super Sundays about like little local expressions serving in a neighborhood, invite your neighbors, walk to church. I'm like, that makes so much more sense for kind of how we express ourselves as a community, I think. And so I'm so excited about trying this because I just think it's going to be beautiful. And I wanted to say just another really quick thing off the back of that which is to say that yes, we are leaning into being a multi-site church and we hope that this will be the first new expression that we launch. We'd like to see other expressions as well bubbling up as and when the time is right. But that doesn't mean that we're not also excited about creating new and different types of community as well. And so I'd love to plant a church. Like how cool would it be to plant a church or two, you know? And we're also really excited about creating missional communities. So before we started this conversation, you two were talking about skate parks slash basketball courts, reaching out to people. Like I would describe what you guys were talking about as a missional community, i.e. a community which is inspired by the mission of Jesus, going out and doing good things in the world, absolutely amazing, which is different to a worshipping community which is centered around the worship of Jesus. It's around the mission of Jesus and kind of out in the world. And so we're very excited. So we say every week we're creating communities which bring hope and joy to Gloucestershire. And when we say communities, we don't mean sites. We mean sites and church plants and home groups and ministries and missional communities. If it's people coming together to extend the kingdom, fantastic. Let's do those things. Let's not limit our creativity. Is that a good answer? Yeah? I would just like to say as well, because we could talk about this all day, we love church. I think the more that we have given ourselves to the churchy stuff, the more we're like, oh yeah, this is our thing to do. And we will die with our boots on in whatever form and shape that looks like. So this is our lifestyle. This is who we are and how we function in the world as far as I'm concerned. So yeah. Yes. Is the aim to grow the North site to have similar elements to the central site in terms of firstly what the service looks like and secondly in terms of the outreach elements. So whether that's gardening projects, grow baby, try and chat, et cetera, add to the list. Great. I have some thoughts. Do you want to go? Okay. So one of the things that we have been talking about as we've been thinking and praying and discerning and all of that is exactly that. Are we looking to cookie cutter A to A? And the answer is no, apart from the values. So essentially we are prioritizing our values being what makes us how we are. And the outworking of that may or may not look different in different locations. So in the center, so our values being those four things we spoke about a couple of weeks ago about being a gathered community, being a growing, like from a discipleship point of view, community, being a grounded community in good kingdom theology and being a going, so going out and doing stuff. And so we have been on a windy journey to where we are at the moment. It's looked different at different stages, depending on where we're meeting and who's with us. So like we've done lots more stuff with refugees and asylum seekers in the past because we've had a gaggle within our community. So our desire is to be flexible with the how, but founded on the why? I don't know what the words are. But essentially values, yes. Outworking, we would love it to be individually expressed wherever people are. The reality is it will be a Sunday gathering that we'll be initially starting. So there will be lots of similarities. There will be worship. There will be kids activities. We'll probably play games because Daniel and I will be leading the team at that point. So that's how we roll. And so that's as much, but we would love it to be, I think we're expecting it to be the same rhythm of first Sunday of the month, Super Sunday, and then gatherings. But what they actually do and look like wouldn't necessarily, because it's a different demographic. So what would work in the center based on who comes wouldn't be necessarily appropriate in the north and vice versa. Yes. I'd say that I think this is one of the things that I think I'm most excited about about this process. I might be wrong about this, which is kind of looking at everything that we do as a church, particularly around our Sunday gatherings and asking that really excellent fundamental question of why are we doing this? What are we hoping to achieve by kind of gathering in this way and expressing ourselves in this way? I'm a big believer in the gathered environments. I love those environments. I think they're really important. I think that it's an important open door for people to come in, to come and experience God's goodness and to encounter him in a variety of different ways. And so I'm like, I'm pretty, it's just, I know that not everybody is as enthusiastic about Sunday gathered environments as I am, but I am. And so, but I am excited about the idea of handing this gathering and this congregation over to Chers and Don and the team and saying, okay, well, this is why we play a game every week, because we want to remind ourselves not to take ourselves too seriously. We want to be welcoming of children. We want to do something to just break the ice. We want to be intergenerational. And so if you can achieve those things in a different way that you think would actually be more, you know, a better expression in the center, then go for it. Equally when it comes to the talk, like if the way that we kind of deliver the message every week just isn't working in the north because we're just gathering a different bunch of people, then we, again, take it back to base principles and go, well, why do we open the Bible and speak in this way? And actually we've gathered a group of people that are completely different to the people that we gather in the center. And so we need to be expressing ourselves in different ways. So I'm really excited about kind of going forward kind of values first. And yeah, we'll probably start with what we've got currently because it's what's comfortable and what we know. But I hope that we ask that question as we go of kind of, well, actually, is there a better way we could do this? Is there a more effective way we could do this? And I would like to see these sites as they kind of continue, as they grow and we launch more of them, that each of them looks very different. Like if you imagine a site in Colford and a site in Stroud, like those two expressions would need to look wildly different from one another because those are wildly different neighbourhoods. And so I like the idea of kind of infusing this whole process with creativity and the teams and permission for the teams to be like, go and express yourselves. Like go and gather, go and be Jesus in those neighbourhoods. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I don't know if it's a specific question. It's probably a little bit intangible. But it's more of what you were saying earlier about when there isn't a venue yet and that can impact how your Sunday expression looks and what community is in walking distance from your venue. And so I guess those are things that are\n\nyet to be pinned down. Is that? You're absolutely right. I mean, the reality is we try to pretend, I think, that it's not important, the room that you meet in, but it really is very important. The room that you meet in, where you meet, where it is geographically, how people feel when they walk into it, just communicates so much before we pick up the microphone. And so to a certain extent, we have a list of preferences of what we'd like to find. And in other ways, we're kind of finding that those venues, God is shutting the doors on us. And we're like, oh no. But again, that's fine. That's how we found here. And by being here, God has formed our community in ways that we wouldn't have imagined. And so we're kind of like, okay. So surrendering to that process and going, well, Lord, we're trusting you that there's going to be a big open door here. And we're excited for that. Please help us to walk through it with humility, whatever that looks like. Who's got a question? Yeah. So for somebody exploring faith, how do they know whether to go for Central or Innsworth? I would suggest whichever would be most convenient. So one of the things that we know is that four o'clock on a Sunday afternoon doesn't work for everybody. I found that with my friends when I've invited my friends to church. They've kind of gone, oh, that's a very inconvenient time to be out of the house. And I've kind of bitten my lip a little bit. And so one of the aspects of why we're doing this is to create another option for those who are just doing other things at four o'clock on an afternoon. So generally speaking, if you speak to people in our church, people are like, well, what do you mean? Four o'clock's fine. But you've got to remember there's a kind of self-selection bias going on there because we are the people for whom four o'clock is okay, or we've kind of decided that four o'clock is okay. We've reshuffled things around. But yeah, if somebody is exploring faith and would be interested in exploring faith as part of the church, then we would say, which works for you best? Again, it depends how they're coming to explore faith. If it's relationally, i.e. your neighbor and you are talking, and then you invite them to church, they come to wherever you go. That would make sense, wherever the relational aspect is. If it's a, I think I need to go to church out of nowhere, which we are hearing a lot more of, I'm going to go on the internet, and then they're going to find one that works in a location at a time for them. So that would be self-selection. Any others? Yes, Andrew. You talked about how God influenced your decision to grow the church. Can you just provide some insight of what God told you and what you felt to continue your journey? Absolutely. Were you here last week? Oh, you were in kids' church, weren't you? Have you listened to our podcast? I would love to direct you there because, so last week we tried to answer that as best as we could. So we took people on a journey of, this is where we began 10 years ago in church leadership thoughts. This is how God spoke. These are pictures that we have had, scriptures and stuff that were pertinent to us that we were praying over that led us to plant Gloucester Vineyard Church seven and a half years ago. And then we kind of told the story of how God has been slowly kind of, it feels like, almost threading the needle or like kind of sewing a tapestry or something of like bits from here and bits from here and bits from here to join up to come to where we are at the moment. So my main thing to say would be, have a little listen to our podcast because it should answer that. Equally, we have booklets at the back that have like questions and stuff that tell a bit of the story as well. But do you have anything that you wanted to say specifically to that? Maybe. I mean, I think the idea of kind of churches growing is, it's potential for a bit of minefield for church leaders and for churches in general. I've already shared a bit of our journey around kind of coming and planting this church and being like, we've got to grow this thing as quickly as we possibly can and how God has very mercifully put that to death within us. Thank you, Lord. But there is certainly a truth to which, you know, I believe that healthy things do grow and that if we're doing our job well as a community, if we are inviting people to come and explore faith, if we are being hospitable and welcoming, if we are speaking to culture in a way that is relevant, if we are worshipping Jesus, if we're seeing miracles, if we're seeing signs and wonders, if we're seeing all of those things, like for me, it seems natural that the community would grow because people would want to be part of that. Like we want as the church to be a revolutionary force in the world. We don't want to kind of just be a kind of nice kind of Sunday gathering with some nice people say some nice things. We want to be a revolutionary force. And so what we would like to see is people encountering that revolutionary force, hearing the gospel message, having it resonate with them, they're being healed and restored. Like for me, it's natural that that would grow. And part of that growth is that we do then continue to send people out. I think what the church has done in the past is kind of seen the church as the result. We kind of gather people, we keep them and we build a bigger bowl so we can put more people in the bowl. And that's wonderful. Isn't it great to have a big bowl full of people? The point is to fling people back outwards and say, okay, great. You've caught it. You've got the vision. Go back to your neighborhood where you live and go and be Jesus in that neighborhood. And that's a big part of what we're trying to do is to try and kind of go, wonderful. Fantastic. Phew. Now go and do another amazing thing over there. Yes, Pippa. I would just like to feedback. I appreciate you saying to us, if you don't see the people that you did once see because they've gone to North Church, that's not our fault. Like I appreciate that you kind of acknowledge you're not holding a social for us on a Sunday. And if we have Christian friends, we should actually see them during the week and not just kind of go, oh no, but I see them on Sunday. I don't need to see them the rest of the time. So it kind of, I think it has woken me slightly to like being like, oh, I need to be an active Christian friend as well as being an active Christian, I suppose. Thank you for saying that. Yes, very good. I appreciate you saying that. But I think that that's a really, it's helpful to keep at the fore, particularly when we're launching a new expression because that's how community is built, isn't it? Is by living alongside people and checking in on them and praying with them outside of that once a week. Appreciate, do you know what? We live in the 21st century West and it's very busy and you have to be very productive all the time and there's always a million demands on your time. But maybe that's also something that we need to think about and how we're embracing that in our life as well of being like, actually, what am I prioritizing? How am I prioritizing that? And am I happy with that? So thanks. So I regularly commute through that area on my bike. How would you like me to pray as I cycle by? Oh, fantastic. Lord, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. I think practical things would be to pray for a venue, pray for somewhere for us to gather, would be to pray for the Holy Spirit to be working in the hearts of those who live in that neighborhood who might like to come and explore faith with us. That'd be great for praying for good relationships to be built. Yeah, I was going to say relationships would always be my number one. So with the community and with this term, like a person of peace, i.e. like a person who just seems to unlock things and have a good connection with the neighborhood. Yeah. Wisdom as well. We will always, always say pray for wisdom for us, the team, the neighborhood, et cetera. Just from what you were saying about relationships being the heart of this community building, as you mentioned, Daniel, there are sort of different communities within that north area, I guess. And how does that look trying to create a church base that serves that north area when there's quite distinct communities already within that that maybe aren't naturally crossing over? I don't know much about the sort of social geography of that region, so I don't have any insight to offer in that regard, but I don't know if that's something that you're noticing, you're coming up against and thinking about or plans around that? Yeah, that's a great question. Would you be able to say anything about the kind of demographics? I feel like he's in the room, so why not? Anything you, you don't have to. I can say something if you don't want to. So if we think about a neighborhood like Innsworth, are you thinking about Innsworth in particular? The example you gave of Innsworth versus Churchdown. Yeah, the north site we talked about has been like Longford through Churchdown, which covers that area. So if the suggestion is that there are quite different communities there that aren't naturally coalescing or overlapping, how is that going to come about with a church that serves all of those areas? Great question. Welcome to the\n\npeople from this background and the reality is we're gathered around the person of Jesus. And so practically, what does that look like? I don't know, but people gather around the person of Jesus. And if we're truly following with humble hearts and loving attitudes and openness and generosity, we find ourselves focusing upon the person of Jesus surrounded by people who don't always look like us. And I think that that is an essential part of what church is. And so I don't know how you get, like if there is a big divide, I don't know. But if there is, then surely Jesus is the answer. And that sounds really like nebulous and like, Jesus is the answer. But the reality is that's what I see here and what we will be praying for in the North as well. Yeah, I mean, I love what you said. Great, love that. Good. It's worth just acknowledging that this North site will be in a neighborhood and when we go out and serve, it will primarily land in that neighborhood. But we will be hoping to gather people from all around, whoever wants to join. But yeah, I mean, as we've been looking at kind of Innsworth as a neighborhood and we may end up in Innsworth, we may end up somewhere else, we don't know. But I've been really excited about that challenge actually, because there are so many distinct groups and ethnicities within Innsworth because of the NATO barracks and just the housing and the new housing being built. It's just a super diverse neighborhood. And I just like, I think all churches should be diverse by nature. And so the idea of launching into a new diverse neighborhood, very exciting, I think. Anything else? Anybody else got a burning, burning question? It can be a silly question or awkward question. Tiny question, massive question. You've got one, yeah. Would the recommendation from you guys be to go to just one and be a part of that community? Or if you go to one, have you now signed up for that one for, in your eyes, that's your site. We'd want you to be in that site now every week or could you flip-flop between? That is an exceptionally helpful question, thank you. I would say that if you're asking us what we think would be best, it would be choose a site and invest in it. Stick at it. As has been pointed out, this is something that usually a large church would do, which might be able to kind of accommodate for that margin of folks kind of wafting between one gathering and another of a Sunday, which might, whichever kind of works best on the Sunday. I think if that happens, this whole plan probably won't work. And so what we really, really need to see is the majority of folks staying really well invested in the center. Simply because it takes some critical mass to gather in this venue in the way that we do. And so we would very much encourage everybody in the church to spend some time praying about where would God like me for the next two years, three years, I would say, to be invested. And then once we've kind of come to that conclusion, to stick at it. Yeah, I was just immediately thinking like on a small scale, if we likened it to home groups, we have home groups that meet on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday with it. And so if somebody was to just go to the one that was convenient for the week that they were having, they'd never be invested in a home group and they wouldn't build the community. And that would be really unhelpful for their home group as well. And so choose one, commit, stick. Sometimes you'll be able to make it, sometimes you won't. But choose one and love it well. Or equally, you're not going to be really weird about it. So for like a year's time, you're like, actually, I feel like the Lord's calling me north. We're not going to be like, no, no, you said that you'd stay in the center. How dare you? Yeah, there will be a whole load of transfer paperwork you'll have to do. It'll be very boring. So yeah, no, of course, we're not going to be weird about it. But we would like to encourage everybody to prayerfully consider where the Lord is encouraging them to be. Anybody else? The only other thought that I thought might be helpful today that we'd kind of prepared to say in case all of you were like, I'm here, but I have no questions, which you haven't done, so well done, is to talk about just why we've decided to go north. Would that be an interesting thing to talk about? Well, there is that. That was not a thought. I was going to say, we do live north, but we basically, the question was north or south. And it was very much like both were on the table for a long time. So we would have gone south as well. Yeah, so would that be interesting to talk about or not? You're all very polite. You can shake your heads and say no. You're interested. Okay, so we'll talk very quickly about that. So there wasn't really the time to share this last Sunday just because we were kind of pressed for time. And so we felt like God asked us to make this move. As a leaders team, we agreed that it was the direction we should go in. And so kind of the next kind of logical questions are where are we going to go and do this? And how the dickens are we going to do this? And so really the first question that we asked was, do we feel like God is really, really specifically saying, I want you to go here to this particular neighborhood? And we remembered when we came, we showed a little bit of our story last week. When we came here, we didn't feel like God had said, I want you to go to Gloucester or I want you to go to Glasgow or somewhere like that. Instead, we felt like there was a call to go and start a church. And so for us, the process was about kind of setting a date in the diary and then praying about where, and that bit came next. And so we kind of felt like we were in the same process of saying, okay, Lord, we're going to put a date in the diary and then we're going to pray that where would kind of, you would reveal the where to us. And that has very much been our experience. We didn't feel like God said very clearly, I want you to plant a site in the North. We felt like he said, I want you to plant a site. And so get going on that. Yes. And get going on that and I will kind of reveal the rest to you. And so the kind of process that we went through was, let's look at this from a whole bunch of different angles. Let's ask the question, where are there fewer churches like ours in the city? So like, where is there kind of an opportunity where we could go and express ourselves where there aren't many churches like ours? Another question was, where are there kind of Gloucester Vineyard church people already? So we've talked about kind of building genuine community and it's that much harder to build genuine community if you don't live in the same neighborhood as the people that you're gathering with. The other question we asked about were, where are there kind of unique opportunities? So where there's new houses being built. We spoke to our friends here at the Methodists because we know the person who leads the whole circuit very well and we went to her and said, are there any buildings like how we use St. John's? Could we use another building? And we also asked a question that Alice kind of hinted at there, which was, is there a way we could do this to make our lives easier? Which sounds like the kind of question that you're not really supposed to ask when you're discerning something from God. But the reality is this is going to be hard work. And so if we don't feel like God is specifically saying you must go here, which we would of course say yes to, if there are ways that we could kind of use our intellect, use our logic, use our wisdom and go, is there a way we could actually make this easier and more likely to succeed? Like if we don't feel like God's saying it's here or nowhere else, is there somewhere that we could go that would actually kind of help with the flow of things? And so really having gone through that process, we identified two neighborhoods. One of them was in the North and the other one was in the South, kind of Quedgeley, Kingsway kind of area, two areas that we felt there was kind of a vineyard shaped hole that we felt that we could go and step into. But one of the things that we kind of, we then went through the rest of it and went, well actually at that point there was very few people kind of down in the South. There was a handful but not too many and there was a much more kind of logical grouping of people up in the North. And the second question was about kind of, is there a way that we could do it that would make things easier? And just at that point it was kind of becoming obvious that Em and I would be taking quite a strong lead in the North and we kind of went, well, we live up in the North and so it'd be so much easier for us to kind of step in and do stuff up there if it's in our neighborhood anyway. And so we didn't feel like God had kind of slammed the brakes on any of that. We kind of started to make some movements towards, we met with some of the other church leaders up there, we started praying for the neighborhood and trying to meet people and walking around and we felt like there wasn't any moment where the Lord was like, no, no, no, no, no, it's not the North. And so we've kind of pushed forward gently on that basis. And so personally\n\ntrying something on for a set amount of time and seeing how that feels and seeing the fit like that is a perfectly legitimate way of discerning something is to go okay God has spoken in this way but not in this way so I'm going to try out this and prayerfully try out this and every time I'm thinking and walking through and whatever I'm praying about it and see see what happens see how God speaks through me trying something on for a set amount of time and at the end of it go huh this is what I've learned this is how God has spoken through that so just helpful from a discernment point of view so yeah. Any questions off the back of that? Okay I feel like we've been doing this for a small eternity so let's wrap it up shall we? Do you want to pray for us and then we can pop across the way? God we thank you for your church and we pray your kingdom come and your will be done here on earth in Gloucestershire as it is in heaven and so Holy Spirit would you come and fill our hearts minds bodies and souls with your transformative presence will you guide us will you lead us will you transform us as we step into what we believe you have for us as a community and we pray again your kingdom come and your will be done amen."

    "transcript": "I speak in the name of the Lord, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Amen. In the Harry Potter books, the characters are very rarely simply caricatures. Each one grows in complexity as the novels progress, and so we see them in a different light, sometimes influencing the storyline in surprising ways. One of the most endearing of these is Dobby, the house elf, a diminutive creature possessing great magical power, but slave to the malicious Malfoy family, who treat him despicably. Because of his links to the Malfoys, Dobby appears to be antagonistic towards Harry. It later transpires, however, that some of his apparently hostile actions were in fact attempts to protect the boy from death. When Harry tricks the Malfoys into releasing Dobby from servitude, the elf takes his freedom very seriously. He still believes that service is integral to his place in the world, and he continues to work hard for others and for very little reward. He also displays a profound loyalty to Harry and gives up his life to save him, an action that goes beyond the call of service, eventually enabling a decisive defeat of evil. It might help us to understand our gospel reading today if we look at it in context and include the four verses that immediately precede it, which are these. Jesus said to his disciples, Occasions for stumbling are bound to come, but woe to anyone by whom they come. It would be better for you if a millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea than you cause one of these little ones to stumble. Be on your guard. If another disciple sins, you must rebuke the offender, and if there is repentance, you must forgive. And if the same person sins against you seven times a day and turns back to you seven times a day and says, I repent, you must forgive. So take it as a whole, this passage consists of four sayings. The first two, not causing an innocent person to stumble in their search for God, and both rebuking and forgiving the offender are challenging for the disciples, hence their request to Jesus for greater faith. And this is the point at which today's reading starts. Notice that the disciples recognize that they have faith that is dynamic and able to grow. And by asking Jesus to increase it, they also acknowledge that it's not simply a matter of their own strength. Jesus responds by prompting them not to see faith in quantitative terms, rather than requesting more. They must let the small faith they have be open to the power of God, who can work through their lives in ways that defy ordinary human experience. As the passage continues, we move from an encouraging tone to a more threatening tone, and the stories become more complex and destabilizing. We need to be most careful in a society with very different attitudes towards slavery from first century Palestine. So we must be careful how we approach this text. If the question raised is not about how a master treats a slave, but about how the slave understands their role, it might help to remember that Jesus sees himself in a positive light as an obedient servant. We may also find it useful to recall Martin Luther's insight that it is only as we discover ourselves to be dutiful servants of all that we also encounter true freedom. It might also help to understand that regardless of what we do, we cannot do more than is expected of us by God. So basically nothing is achieved by working ourselves into the ground or putting pressures on others. That is not God's will. And we as servants of God take our direction only from him. God owes us nothing and God's blessing comes in the gift of grace. It is not earned by us. So let's get down to the nitty gritty. What exactly is faith? Faith is total dependence on God and a willingness to do his will. Faith is not something we use to put on a show for others. It is complete and humble obedience to God's will. Readiness to do whatever he calls us to do. The amount of faith isn't as important as the right kind of faith. Faith in our all-powerful God. A mustard seed is small, but it is alive and growing. Just like a tiny seed, a small amount of genuine faith in God will take root and grow. Almost invisible at first, like a seed it will begin to spread first under the ground or in our cases from the inside and then visibly. And although each change may be gradual and imperceptible, very soon this faith will have produced major results that will uproot and destroy competing loyalties. The ability to discern God's will will become clearer. So you see, we don't need more faith. A tiny seed of faith is sufficient. It is alive and growing. But like any seed, it needs to be kept warm and watered if it is to develop deep roots. And in our case, as Christians, that will be through prayer and praise and a deep love and passion for our God. That is the message Jesus was trying to get across to his disciples. By prompting them to examine the roots of their faith and their true place in their relationship with God, Jesus reminds them that spiritual health requires awareness of both their own sinfulness and God's unlimited love for them. Through faith, we can do what God desires of us, but never anything more. And as God's servants, we do nothing for which we expect to be rewarded. But when we prioritize our own concerns over obedience to God, that is when we fall into sin. And sin is never a private matter. Sin always has social consequences. There is always an impact on others.\n\nAnd this is a message that is amply illustrated by the storylines in Harry Potter, where even Dobby's misguided earlier attempts to protect the boy causes problems whose after-effects ripple through the plot. For churches who prioritise serving both God and their community, remembering that we are not seeking reward or recognition should help us to clarify our focus. When the disciples request increased faith, Jesus' response sets them free to live with self-knowledge on behalf of those who need their service. This is not heroism. Instead, it requires steady application to our God-given tasks with a love that understands and accepts that its duty is never done. So my message to you today is not to spend time worrying whether you're good enough to be part of the Christian family. For whatever reason you may think you're not, forgive yourself. Forgive yourself. Exchange that worry time for watering time. Water that mustard seed of faith and watch it grow. God will bless you. Amen."

    "transcript": "We have this month been talking about church during the month of September. A couple of weeks ago we were looking at how and why the church, like the church in general, is absolutely wonderful. And last week we talked about some of the characteristics that define us as a community, so this church, and how we feel God has shaped and formed us to be this specific expression of his church here and now. So if you missed either of them, feel free to catch up on our podcast found on, or what's that phrase? Anyway, search Gloucester Vineyard Church. And today we thought we would bring this all together and we would both come and we would, well I was going to say share the mic, but have two separate mics. Because we have a bit of family business, as I mentioned earlier. We want to talk about some exciting next steps for us as a community as we move into what we sense God is calling us to over the coming years. And so we thought we would start by going on a bit of a storytelling journey, if you will indulge us. We just want to take some time to unpack a bit more of the Gloucester Vineyard story so far. What we've been hearing from God for us as a community. And that's in order to put into context and make sense of us talking about what's coming next. Does that sound alright? Good. Tough if not. Good, I was going to say that's what we're doing, so whether you like it or not. Let's rewind a few years then. Go on. So about 10 years ago when we were younger, more energetic, and had more hair, Em and I were in the process of getting ready to come and plant this church. Now if you've not heard the term church planting before, it's basically where you go somewhere where there isn't a church already and you start one from scratch. We felt really sure as a couple and as a family that that's what God was asking us to do. But we had all sorts of important questions about that process like where? Quite an important question to answer. Where and how and when and all that kind of stuff. How on earth are we going to do this? And so we went to go and visit some very wise friends of ours who've planted a church before. And we asked them these questions and they gave us a sage piece of advice which was when you plant is more important than where you plant. They said when you go is more important than where you go. Hands up if you, like me, think that that is bonkers advice. Yeah, it's bonkers advice, right? That's totally bonkers. But they responded when I said that's bonkers advice. They said, well, how many times have you had a conversation with people that goes along the lines of, oh, we were always going to go and do that amazing thing for God, but the timing was never quite right. Never quite was the right timing, so we never did it. You know, we feel like God asked us to do something, but, you know, it was the wrong time with the kids or something was going on with my career or I was washing my hair. And so we just never did that amazing thing that God asked us to do. So they said to us, when you go is more important than where you go. So get the when set in stone and the where will all follow. So we thought, what have we got to lose? Let's give this a try. So we went away and we prayed about it and we felt like God kind of laid on our hearts to plant a vineyard church somewhere in the early stages of 2018. And so we kind of aimed our life in that direction. And wouldn't you know that as we did that, as we kind of put that date in the diary, everything else in our life kind of followed the flow. So we found jobs, we figured out pretty quickly that it was going to be Gloucester. And here we are, February 2018, Gloucester Vineyard Church was born. Hooray! So first of all, do you want to see some photos of the first ever gathering? So we were at the climbing wall just on Parliament Street. There you go. Teeny tiny little room there. We just packed ourselves in there. There's a picture of Emily and I. We didn't have microphones back then, but I was pretending to hold a microphone. I don't know if we've got that other picture. Anyway, there's another one in there. We look younger. And then the following Sunday we did our very first Super Sunday. Look, there we are, out loving and serving the community with just a whole bunch of randomers who decided to come with us. Fair play to those guys who actually came out on that first ever Super Sunday. So that was about seven and a half years ago. And what a journey it's been. We've moved to various different venues over the years. We had the wonderful COVID years. Yes, shout out for Zoom church. Never again. We've always done Super Sundays. We've always tried to be servant-hearted. We've always played games and tried not to take ourselves too seriously. We've always preached the good news about the kingdom of God. We've always met in home groups and worshipped and eaten together. We've celebrated. We've mourned. And over that time God has changed and formed and moulded this church in ways that we, before we came here 10 years ago, could never have imagined. We could never have dreamed what God would ask us to do. You know, how he's consistently laid things in front of us of how he wants us to express his love and his kingdom here in Gloucestershire. You know, I think about starting a Christians Against Poverty debt centre within the first couple of years of the church's existence. It's just, we would never have thought that that was a good idea. I think about starting Grow Baby a couple of years ago. That was amazing. You know, a couple of years ago we ran like a county-wide clothing campaign to clothe 300 people are seeking asylum. Like, where did that come from? It was just laid in front of us as an opportunity. And it was really fun to say yes to. We love this church, Emma and I. We love leading this church. You guys are a consistent joy to us. And we're really excited to continue leading this church as we go on the journey. So, like Daniel says, sometimes the kind of God paths that have been laid in front of us have been one-off things like the clothing campaign that we did for the asylum seekers. Sometimes they've been quite unexpected and a bit of a left turn, like moving to St John's in the afternoon was a bit random for us. If you'd spoken to us four years ago, we would have been like, what? No. But here we are, and it's wonderful. We want to talk today, though, about a particular God path that we feel has been slowly but surely brewing over the years and is now bubbling to the surface. And we want to share that with you. About six years ago, we started to notice a few churchy things that kind of just rankled us a little bit. There seemed to be loads of church buildings just sitting empty around the city or indeed around the county. We were also hearing lots of stories of people from all over Gloucestershire traveling for like 45 minutes to an hour just to find a church to call home. And it was interesting because when lockdown hit five years ago, we noticed that there were quite a few people who fit this category joining us online from the surrounding villages because it was much easier online. And they were quickly becoming key people in our online home groups. And that's kind of when we started thinking, I wonder if GVC is just about like one community in Gloucester or whether there's something else kind of afoot in the county. It bothered us that Super Sunday was only serving one community when we represented several. It kind of bothered us that there were and are a number of neighborhoods that simply don't have a church presence in them at all, even in Gloucestershire, where there's a lot of churches. But there are still many places that do not. And about four years ago, as we were thinking these thoughts, a lovely family from South Africa joined us. Many of you may know Ryan and Lauren. And when they came, they came with a picture. Before they moved here, Lauren had been praying and she had received a picture from the Lord of World War II Dunkirk crossing, Operation Dynamo. Does anyone know about it? Oh, there you go. Basically, it was this mass evacuation in World War II of some Allied forces that were stranded on the beach in Dunkirk in France, stranded between the advancing German army and the sea. And in a wonderfully plucky British move, they basically did a call out to anyone and everyone who had a boat of any shape and size to get it on the water and join the rescue party. So boats of all shapes, sizes, purposes, fishing boats, pleasure boats, you name it, all crossed the channel to go and bring home as many troops as their vessels could. And that was the picture. And Lauren had a sense that it was a picture for the church. This idea of the church being on mission to reach as many people as possible in lots of small little boats of all shapes and sizes, each taking as many as they could hold. And this picture really resonated with us. It resonated deeply with how we were thinking of church at the time and feeling. And maybe God was inviting us to consider multiple smaller church communities rather than one big one. Around this time, we were also seeing quite a few of our fellow vineyard churches across the UK experimenting with what's called multi-site church. Simply, rather than kind of moving to a bigger building or building a bigger building or whatever as the church grows, instead becoming a multi-site church, which is a single church that gathers and serves in multiple locations across a county or a city. And so all of these things,\n\nsurprised when we got too big for a building, what if we just started to plan for it? What if we prayed for leaders to join our community? What if we invested in and trained them when they did? What if we kept our eyes and our ears and our hearts open to what was happening around the county, all in the faith that one day God might tell us that the moment for multiplication in Gloucester Vineyard Church was here? And so we did. We have been stepping into that over the past three or four years, holding and stewarding that vision, believing that God is speaking to us and preparing us for a moment of multiplication. And so last summer, Em and I were very lucky. We got to take a sabbatical from church leadership, which is basically just taking three months away to kind of recharge ahead of going again. And so this time last year, we had just stepped back in again and I was praying and seeking God for what was next for the church. You know, we'd just done seven years. Lord, what have you got next? And I wanted to know, was there anything that he had to say as we were stepping back into church life and back into leadership? And I felt like God called back to mind that moment that I just mentioned when we went to go and visit our friends, even before we started this church, where they said, when you go is more important than where you go. And I felt like God was saying, it's time to put a date in the diary again. It's time to do what I've laid on your heart to do. Now, I would love to say that I had a really good response to this, like Mary in our Bibles when the angel shows up and says she's going to have the baby Jesus. And she says, may it be unto me as you have said, oh Lord. I would love to say that I had that reaction, but actually my response was much more like Moses at the burning bush being like, seriously? Seriously? Our church? Have you seen our church? No offense. I thought they might laugh at that. There's like a slight delayed reaction. I love you guys. So I said, look, come on, Lord, have you seen our church? We're a dinky little church. Like being a multi-site church, creating new communities, that's what big churches do. Our church, it is not. It's a lovely church, but it's not a big church. You know, we don't have the people, we don't have the money, we don't have the energy. Basically, I said, Lord, we can't do what you're asking us to do because we don't have what we need. I said, Lord, give us all of the things that we need first and then we'll do it. How many of us in the room knows that that's not how things work in the economy of the kingdom of God? That's not how things work. How many of us know that faith is spelt R-I-S-K? So often, God is waiting to work, wanting to work, waiting to move, wanting to bless, but he wants us to make the first move before and step out in faith. In my mind, the way that church is multiplied is by just getting really big and see, and then just, because I've seen it happen before. I've been part of churches where that's been the case. You grow and you grow and you fill a space and then you do something to accommodate for the growth. You know, let's be really honest. We are not in that moment. But as we considered what God was saying, we did what one should always do when one senses that God has spoken just to make sure that you weren't eating too much mature cheddar last night. We took this idea, this thing that we thought God was saying about putting a date in the diary to some people that we love and people that we trust, and we asked them to help us to weigh it, to come back to us and say, you know, does this resonate with you? Does this seem like what God is doing? And one of those people went away and prayed and came back with a picture of cells dividing. I don't know if you've ever seen a time lapse of a cell dividing in two. What doesn't happen when a cell divides is it doesn't just get really, really big, get bigger and bigger and bigger and then kind of flop into two half-sized things. Instead, what it does is it creates everything that it needs within itself. And then there's kind of this moment of tension when it flops from one thing into two things. That is the technical scientific term in case you're wondering. Both of those things perfectly formed and functioning. The interpretation being, don't be surprised if God is calling you to do something in a way that is counter to what you'd expect and counter to what you've seen before. And so just like we did 10 years ago, Emma and I, along with our fantastic leaders team, started to pray, Lord, when would you like us to do this? When would you like us to step into becoming a multi-site church and launch a new expression? To step out in faith to what we feel like you're calling us towards. And so after a time of prayer and discernment, we all agreed that we felt that God said to put 18 months on the clock and to aim for Easter 2026. To step out in faith towards the thing that we felt God had said, trusting that he would provide everything that we need at the right moment along the way. To prepare like that cell for the moment of multiplication. Which leads us to today. Welcome. Easter 2026 is like next week. It's not. But it leads us to our exciting announcement, which if you've been paying attention for the last 10 minutes, you could tell me at this stage, right? But just in case you did fall asleep, I'm just going to say it really clearly so that you can share. Here we go. We believe that the time has come. The moment has arrived for us to step out in faith towards what God has been inviting us as a church into for years. And so at Easter 2026, we're going to launch a new expression of Gloucester Vineyard Church in this very city. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, you should cheer. Yeah. Yeah. For the last 12 months as a team, we have been squirreling away in the background, kind of making plans, doing our research, having knotty conversations with our trustees, seeking wisdom from our advisors and our overseers within the vineyard, and seeking wisdom from people who've done this before. Basically getting ready to do what we believe God's calling us to. And today we're going public, so to speak, because we want to share this with all of you as a community. And we want to invite us all to be joining in, to pick up the vision and to step up into our part to play in what God is calling this community into. And so as Daniel said, next Easter, Sunday the 5th of April 2026, we will be launching a new expression of Gloucester Vineyard Church in the north of Gloucester in the mornings. There you go. Two more bits of detail for you. We're currently exploring the specifics of where, but we are heading north for a few reasons, the most compelling of which for us is that the north of Gloucester is expanding significantly and many of the new neighborhoods and areas simply have no church presence in them at all. And as we've said before, we don't think that's okay. To begin with, there will be a very small group of people, eight to 10 people, who will go and who will launch this new expression as a team and build community from scratch. Sunday gatherings will be a simplified, stripped back version of these gatherings. We'll play games, we'll worship, we'll open the Bible and we'll pray together. And we'll be expressing ourselves authentically based on the reality that there will be very few people initially. In the early days, there will be activities for any new kids that show up with their families, but we won't be running a full kids church in the way that we do here at first. The team will also be looking to do local super Sundays, gathering events, maybe an alpha course or two, getting invested in and getting involved in the local community, just like we did seven years ago with this one. Daniel and I will be leading this north team, so we will be at the morning gatherings each week getting things established. But it's worth making it very clear that we will also be present in the afternoons here in the centre as well. We plan to be here just as often as we are at the moment. We'll be preaching, leading worship and serving on teams just as we currently do. Okay, so let's talk a little bit about leadership for a second because this is actually one of the things that I'm really excited about as we go down this path. Another path that we really feel like God has been calling us towards over the last couple of years is to explore the idea of kind of leaning into team leadership in a big way, to try to be a church which is generous and collaborative in our leadership style. Rather than having one or two people who hold all the power and make all of the decisions, instead to be much more equipping and releasing and inviting to have teams of leaders who make decisions together. Now to an extent, this actually hasn't been what's been demonstrated to us or modelled to us in the past, but we feel compelled that this is what God has for our church in the future. And so a big part of what we're doing in becoming a multi-site church and what we're announcing today is a kind of significant step towards that collaborative and generous style of leadership that we feel God is inviting us into. And this really informs a lot of the how when we say how the dickens are we going to do this? The plan is to, that each site, the centre and in the north will be led by a team rather than a\n\nEmily and I, as Emily said, we're going to be leading the team that launches the new expression in the north. In the short term, we will be the site pastors up there. But we intend to hand over to site pastors in the north, basically, as soon as we can. But it's worth clarifying that Emily and my main role will be as overall senior pastors of Gloucester Vineyard Church. Our role will be leading and overseeing both sites. And so, naturally, we will also be establishing site pastors and site teams here in the centre at St John's as well. These will be the people who will take on this central expression with all the exciting momentum that we have here in the city and who will be leading the team to continue bringing hope and joy to the city centre. And so... Would you like to know who it is? Without further ado, we would like to announce that the central site pastors for Gloucester Vineyard Church will be Chez and Don Vincent. Can we get a... Do you want to stand up for a second? Get on your feet. Stand up, you two. Stand up. Hooray. Yeah, exactly. Chez and Don have agreed to lead the team who will be overseeing everything that happens here and we are absolutely delighted. We just want to take a minute to honour you guys. I'll let you sit down so you're not totally embarrassed. We just want to take a minute to honour these guys as they step up. We asked Chez and Don to consider this role for many reasons. Firstly, because we see so much of our church values and our DNA expressed in the way that they live, the way that they run their home. They are joyful, generous people who love Jesus, have a heart for his kingdom and his mission and who live their faith out loud in public. Secondly, they're people who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty. They're hard workers, they're servant-hearted and they're servant leaders, all of which we really value as a church. And lastly, they love this church. They love all of us and they love afternoon church. When we said we were going to the morning, Chez was like, what? Why on earth would anyone go to church in the morning? That's ridiculous. Afternoon church is the best. Yes, exactly. And so we are really chuffed that Chez and Don have said yes to taking the lead here in the centre and we're really excited to see what they and the central team will be doing for Jesus and for his kingdom. We're going to be formally commissioning them in January 2026, but for now, let's just give them another cheer. One thing that it's worth saying is if you're in church leadership or you're moving into it, you need loads of prayer and loads of encouragement. So every time you pray, pray for Chez and Don. Every time you get a picture or a slight word of encouragement, text them, message them, tell them on a Sunday because it's a spiritual battle. I'm not going to lie. And so this is a moment where actually they need as much prayer and love and support as they can. So, got you. So those are some of the details about what's happening where and when. And naturally, we may have a whole host of questions. We're going to answer some today and there's various opportunities to be asking more in the coming weeks. But for now, one of my questions to you, Daniel, can you see how natural this is going to be, is how is this going to change things around here in the centre? How will the launching of the new expression in the north change things? How's it going to affect the centre? Thank you for asking. For starters, so we are working very, very hard to try and launch this new site in such a way that actually week on week, this room doesn't feel very different at all. It might be that there's a handful fewer people initially, but our hope here is that actually things in the centre won't change very much. Chez and Don will be a little bit more visible than Emily and I and will be making a whole load of local decisions, which we're really excited about. But we will still be very involved in the day to day running of the church. Wonderful. So how do I know if I'm going to stay in the centre in the afternoons or if I'm going to go and be part of the team launching in the north? What a great and insightful question. Thanks. So for now, let me just simply say this. Unless we feel a real and definite invitation from God to come and get stuck in in the north, then please stay here in the centre. One of the funny things about the plan that we've created is it's actually quite contingent on lots of people staying here and carrying on as usual. Launching the new expression is going to take quite a lot of hard work and intentionality. Those of us who go will likely, for the first six months or so, we're going to be on team every single Sunday, and there's probably going to be at least one week, one night of the week every single week building community up there. There will be many weeks where there just won't be very many people in the room, and that can be a little bit awkward, and we're just going to roll with that. Now, whilst some of us, we might be like, yes, sign me up, I'm very excited about that, I'm aware that most of us just simply aren't up for that, and that's okay. The reality is, as we all know, there is loads of really exciting kingdom stuff that's happening right here, right now in the city centre. We are not taking our eyes off that, not one bit. What we really need is for this congregation to stay and to stay well, to reach out like never before. Remaining in the centre is not a secondary, less exciting option. Ches and Don and the team are going to be moving forward, and they're going to need all of us here in the centre to play our part in any way that they can. Amen. But Emily, let me ask you a not scripted question in the slightest. Please. Everybody in this room is fantastic. Will I ever see those who go to the north ever again? No. Obviously not. No. But that is a genuinely insightful and thoughtful question that many of us may be feeling, and the reality is that there is a bit of a cost to this, that we will have to pay as a community as we step into multiplication. We're going to have to think outside of Sunday gatherings alone for our friendships and our community to form and to continue. We've seen this happen over and over again with our home groups over the years. Who here has been part of a home group that has multiplied, changed shape, changed days, or changed venues? Yes, many, many, many of us. And it will be the same again. With any change, particularly in a multiply-y kind of way, it causes us to be thoughtful with our time, our energy, and our resource again. Often, we might have to think about how we relate to each other. We might have to find creative ways to ensure that we don't lose relationships with the people that we love. But church is more than Sunday gatherings, right? So, if you haven't already, swap numbers, go out for coffee, eat together, pray together outside of Sundays, encourage each other in the kingdom stuff that is happening, because it's entirely up to us if we see people outside of Sundays again. Are we becoming two churches? We are not. It is really important to emphasize at this moment as well that we are not becoming two separate churches. We are still one church with one vision, with one set of values, one set of trustees, one bank account, one set of senior pastors, and so there will be plenty of stuff that will happen as one church together. Home groups will be shared across the sites. Go to whichever one suits you on the best day or in the best location for you. Youth home group is included in that, so that will be across both sites. Youth from both sites will go to home group together. Home group leaders' training will continue to be across the sites. Our ministries like Chai and Chat, Vibes, Grow Baby will be supported and championed across both sites. But on top of that, there will also be kind of intermittent get-togethers that we will inevitably do, where both sites will get together and have a moment of connection. Think, for example, church weekend away. Thanks. Prompting a whoop every time, thank you. Our approach to answering the question about, like, is that a north thing, a central thing, or like a combined thing, is to ask actually instead, what will be most effective for the kingdom and most simple for the community? So if there's something that is more effective, simpler, and sustainable to stay within each expression, we'll do that. If there's something that would be more effective, simple, and sustainable to be done combined, we will do that. There's many, many more questions that people may have about this, some of which we know the answers to, some of which we don't, and they will come in due course. But we have created a couple of ways to accommodate some of your questions. Firstly, we have\n\ncreated a nifty little booklet. Ooh, fancy. We're like a proper church and everything. In here, we've basically talked, there's a lot of information about what we've talked about today, plus some more details and kind of other detailed questions in there as well. So we will put these at the back at the end. So please feel free to take one per household, preferably. Have a little read, have a reflect, have a peruse and get back to us. So hopefully this will answer some of your questions. Secondly, we have created a couple of opportunities in the coming weeks where we will have a Q&A session. So as we said earlier, next week at Supercharged Sunday, Daniel and I will be leading a workshop Q&A session in here. So if you have any, bring your questions, ask your things and we'll have a good discussion. Equally, there'll be a Monday evening in October where we will have a Zoom meeting for anyone with more questions as well. So watch out in the weekly email, there will be time to ask all of those. Please bring along your thoughts, ask your questions, share your feelings. We want to hear them. Yes, we do. Can I bring our time together to close with some real blunt honesty? Is this okay? Still an okay place to be really blunt and honest? Yeah? Yes. You're like, no, I don't like the sound of that. Please sugarcoat everything. No, I won't. Let's address the elephant in the room, shall we? Making the change to being a multi-site church is a risk. When we do this, it is going to be costly and we are going to feel it. It's going to cost us time and energy and money. It's going to be a risk. So why are we doing this? Why are we doing this? Hopefully you've got half an answer. Hopefully I've got some answers here on this piece of paper. I'd like to give you three reasons why we're doing this. The first and most important one is that we think that God has asked us to do this. This is not a knee-jerk, flippant, glib, I think I heard God speak last week, so we're just going to risk it all on a roll of the dice. We have been sensing that God has been saying this for most of the time that we have existed as a church. And since we started this process 12 months ago, we have been repeatedly seeking wise counsel. We've gone back to God. We've done everything we can to be as sure as we can that we are moving slowly and carefully with as much confidence as we can to what God has for us next. We believe that God has told us to do this, and that is the biggest reason. The second reason is that this is part of our vineyard DNA. We are part of a larger movement of churches across the UK and around the world called the Vineyard Movement. There are thousands of vineyard churches currently in existence because this is what we do. Church multiplication is part of our heritage. It's part of what it means to be a vineyard church. We are here, we exist as a church because Aylesbury Vineyard launched Gloucester Vineyard. Aylesbury Vineyard was launched by Riverside Vineyard. Riverside Vineyard was launched by Southwest London Vineyard. You get the point. As vineyard churches, this is what we do. We spread out. We create communities. This is part of our heritage. This is part of our DNA. The third and final reason, and the reason why the vineyard is so obsessed with launching new worshiping communities, is because establishing new worshiping communities has been shown to be the best, most effective evangelism strategy that there is. As a church, we want to see the kingdom of God advancing. We want to see new people coming into the kingdom, encountering Jesus for the first time, being healed and restored, and giving their allegiance to him. We want to see people joining in the revolutionary family of God, learning to know him as their father, and learning to walk in Jesus' footsteps. And we know that establishing new worshiping communities where there currently are none is the most effective way of seeing that happen. It's been the strategy for the last 2,000 years, so really, this is nothing new. And so, whilst we agree, this plan is a risk, that it's going to be costly and difficult for us as a church, we are confident that this is what God is inviting us into in the coming years. We are convicted that this is what churches, not just ours, should be doing, because it's what the church has done for generations. And we are convinced that if we're serious about seeing the kingdom of God advancing in the county, this is how we go about seeing it. And so, as we wrap up, I just want to recall the stuff of September that we've been looking at as a community. As we've explored church, the church, this church, being a devoted, active, Jesus-shaped community, gathered together, grounding ourselves in good theology, growing in our discipleship to Jesus, and going into the world to proclaim the good news of the kingdom in any way that we can. This is a moment for us as Gloucester Vineyard Church to turn up the heat of what it means to be this community in this place at this time. To ensure that the church doesn't fade into the background, but actually steps up into the fore. This is not something that a handful of the leaders team are going to be doing. It involves all of us to step up, step in, and to play our part, because that is what church is. It is the body of Christ together. It's not a hobby or a spectator sport. It's an alive, transformative community, seeking the king and the kingdom in all things. And so, the kids will come back in at some point in the next few minutes. No, they won't. I told her to keep them. Okay. We've got loads of time. Fine. Heather has your children. It's all fine. In which case, we're going to take a minute to respond. Kiri and Katie and Charlotte, would you mind coming up? We're actually going to sing a song together. It's one that we've been singing a bit over the summer. And we feel like it's one that we want to sing together as a community, particularly in this moment, where we have prayed our prayers and we've made our plans. But we want to welcome Holy Spirit to come, because if God's not in it, we're not interested. We feel like this is what God is calling us to. But we want to take a moment to surrender all that we have spoken about today, all of our thoughts and feelings that we might have off the back of today, and give them back to Jesus for him to do what he wants with his church. Does that sound good? So if you are able to and willing, then please do stand. We're going to sing together, and then we'll go into communion. I'll leave that."

    "transcript": "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. The end of the New Testament lesson. Gasp hold of a life that is really life. What have we thought sometimes about people, you haven't lived, have you? And that's what the church is about in a sense. What is the true life? Because sometimes it seems that people around us, sometimes we ourselves feel we're almost dead. Because what that means is different in different places. In Jerusalem, we have the story about the rich man who tried to live what he regarded as a good life. A rich life. Rich in the monetary sense. What happened to him? Didn't get much chance. He snuffed it before he had a chance to enjoy himself. Somewhere else in the Mediterranean region, I don't know where, Paul is writing to Timothy. And he says that the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. So avoid it. Don't be trapped by senseless and harmful desires. Much the same message, but differently put certainly. An awareness of how easily money can get hold of us. And then in Jerusalem again, Jeremiah. Looks quite different actually, doesn't it? He's told to invest. Not to save. Not to spend. But to invest. Invest in a plot of land. This is with the invaders just over the horizon. What use is that going to be to him? But he goes through the rigmarole. Weighing out the money. Eleven shekels of silver, wasn't it? What's that equivalent to these days? Hundred thousand quid? Something like that for a piece of land? I don't know the figures. It doesn't matter either. But you get what I'm talking about. Somehow he seemed to have got quite a lot of cash. And he spent it or rather invested it in a piece of land that was going to be occupied in a few days' time by an invading force of, what were they, Assyrians? Babylonians? I can't remember. I lose track of all these people that came back and forth. It wasn't going to be much use to him for his lifetime. But he made a point of doing the equivalent of registering it with the land registry. Which in those days consisted of getting an earthenware pot and hiding it somewhere where presumably he told a number of people where to dig it up when it all blown over. That was going to take, well, 70 years of captivity, wasn't it? And another 10 years for the whole thing to happen. In 80 years' time, go and reclaim that land. Because houses and vineyards and fields will be sold and bought again. But not just now. So use what you've got wisely, is the message of Jeremiah. It's rather different from the apparently rather negative way that the man gets condemned for thinking only of his own comfort and taking no notice whatsoever of Lazarus. The beggar at his gate. It wouldn't have cost him very much to feed, to look after a little bit. And just remember how Jeremiah came to know about his cousin. Two ways, basically. One, the word of the Lord came to him and said, your cousin, Shalom, he's going to come to you. Now, I don't know how that sort of experience happens exactly. I know that it's different for different people, certainly. But have you ever thought, I wonder about so-and-so? And then found it happening. Because the cousin actually comes to Jeremiah and says, buy my field at Anatoth, which is Jeremiah's hometown, because you've got the right. Property rights in ancient Israel are fairly complicated. Not as bad as England now, but fairly complicated. But this was the position, that Jeremiah had the right as being a particular relative to purchase this land. He'd had a thought first, given to him by God, yes, but I think he needed confirmation. Because the text actually says, when the cousin arrived, I knew that the Lord had spoken. Now, he had spoken, yes. But Jeremiah knew it because it was beginning to happen. Somehow he had known before. That was God working in him. Sometimes we wouldn't use such language, yes. The word of the Lord came to me. Nonetheless, he speaks on occasions, through circumstances, through our thoughts. Bear that in mind. Anyway, three stories about money. Now, it's too good when you've got three different readings about money to miss the opportunity of giving you a great lecture as treasurer now rather than as preacher. Okay? So I'm going to warn you, if you don't give up much of your personal wealth, you'll die. Be warned. Give it away now. And I can explain how to give it away very easily. I won't bother you with the numbers now, but the bank account's open. You can't have those love of money. It just can't happen. And secondly, of course, the business in Paul talking to Timothy. The love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. So often shortened, quite wrongly, to money is the source of all evil. No, not quite. The love of money is the source of all kinds of evil. And I think we can see so many cases where that's obviously true. So what I'm going to tell you, of course, is that only by making yourself poor can you possibly hope to be a genuinely good person, let alone to be a Christian. Thirdly, of course, I'll tell you that all that you've got that you can invest, all of it, was put into the church, the work that is being done by the PCC and so forth. Not in your house or your family. The church will take care of it. That's the treasure of life, isn't it? I hope that doesn't sound too familiar. There's plenty of caricatures that believe that Christianity is just like that. And too often, I'm afraid, the examples mainly come from the other side of the pond. We haven't found out about what happens in England. It's the way. The church itself is money-grubbing. Yes, we need it. But if that's the only thing that drives us, we've surely detached ourselves from the Word of God. We need to look more deeply than that superficial glance at the things that the Bible says into the Word of God. I mean, it's also been much kinder to ourselves, actually.\n\nSo easily, all the messages of Christianity get portrayed in terms of trying to make you feel guilty. It's not a great deal of point. It doesn't work. It's the wrong thing to do. But if we want to truly follow our Lord and Saviour, what can we learn from what we just heard from the Scriptures? Think again about the letter to Timothy. Do we claim to love God? Or perhaps we claim to want to love God and want to learn how to do it better. That's certainly more like me. I don't know about you. If we love God, we can't let love of something else get in the way. You can't really love both God and money. That's exactly what Jesus says, isn't it? If our real desires are the trappings of wealth, that's no use to us at all. Nor indeed can we claim a place in the Kingdom of Heaven that we've bought. It's the worst of all, I think. Oh yes, I'm a generous contributor to the things of God, therefore I will go to Heaven. No, you won't. Any more than you'll go there because you're trying hard to be good. It's God's grace that gives us a place in Heaven. Not what we give or what we do. So relax about your money. Don't love it, but use it. And think about the rich man in Jesus' story. He was a failure in love. Love for his fellow human being, in this particular instance, Lazarus. He was determined to enjoy his particular self-indulgence. Avoiding such extremism. That's what it is, isn't it? Extremism is a dirty word, but being an extremist about money somehow seems to many people to be more appropriate than being extreme about your religion or about your philosophy of life. Anyway, we can certainly avoid that extremism. Be encouraged that however little you do, in fact, for someone else, however much you share with others, individually or through organisations like the church, or through relief organisations, whoever it is, every little bit matters. But let the love of God come first. And then think about Jeremiah. Investing rather than spending, hoarding or... investing. Doing that because he knew that's what God wanted him to do. He knew it wouldn't be much use to him. It was a bad investment in that sense. But he believed, because he was called. But he didn't actually recognise that call when it started. He had to respond to what was in front of him in a particular way. But he knew already what he had to do. Are you sometimes unsure about what you ought to do? Thinking, maybe I ought to... I don't know what. It may be God calling you. Or that call may come through somebody else who suggests what you could do is... Or would you like to... All sorts of ways in which the call of God genuinely can come to us. I believe that God, in fact, calls us to invest. To invest in his kingdom. The question we ought to ask, of course, is how? In investments, it's reasonable to ask in financial terms, well, what's the best return? Do I get better money from investing in Nationwide than in Lloyd's? Or whatever. You know, the answer very often is much of a muchness to the various things that happen. But that's a question that needs to be asked within the investment we make. What I hope we ask as we invest as Christians is not what gets us the best returns, but what yields the most in building the kingdom of God here on earth. So don't go asking yourself, if I give a bit more, will that mean that the sermons are a bit better? Or the music's more to my taste? But you may ask, if I give a bit more, will more people actually have the opportunity to know Jesus as I know him? Will the community come together more to care for each other? Will people around me be happier, more content with their lives? Is that the sort of return we're looking for by investing in this church? It's a question that the PCC ought to be concerned with, certainly. What are we doing that shows that's worth investing in? And each of us should ask that same question. How can we most invest in the kingdom of God? And each of you has to ask that question of yourself. Maybe he's looking to me for the answer in your particular situation. Or anybody else. Although you may look for advice. But God waits for our response. Be that from James or the PCC, or anybody else that's in a leading position here. Or from us as individuals. Each of us trying and failing sometimes, but so what? To be loving and giving people. Invest what you have with your money, your time, your energy, your prayer. In God's kingdom. What did Jesus say? All the rest will be given you as well. Take hold of that promise. Amen. If it's comfortable for you, may I please invite you to stand and let us affirm our faith in the world."

But God waits for our response, be that from James or the PCC, or anybody else that's in a leading position here, or from us as individuals, each of us trying and failing sometimes, but so what, to be loving and giving people. Invest what you have, both your money, your time, your energy, your prayer in God's kingdom. What did Jesus say? All the rest will be given you as well. Take hold of that promise. Amen. If it's comfortable for you, may I please invite you to stand and let us affirm our faith in the..."

    "transcript": "to reflect and to remind ourselves as a community about the kind of community that God has called us to be and the things that are important to us. So last week, who heard Emily's talk last week? Wasn't it a stonker? If you missed Emily's talk last week, go back on the podcast and listen to Emily's talk. Last week, Emily talked a bit about what it means to be a church kind of at a foundational level, kind of church with a capital C. What is a church? And next week, we're going to be sharing, taking a moment to share about what we feel God is calling us onto in the coming years. But this week, we just wanted to take a chance to zoom in and pay a bit of attention to the church that God has called us to be. Talk a bit about our values and our DNA as a church to identify a few really kind of core and important things about who we are as a community, as Gloucester Vineyard Church, who God has called us to be. And we do this once a year for a couple of reasons. One of them is that for some of us in the room, this is our first September as part of Gloucester Vineyard Church. So you might not have heard some of this stuff before. It might be your first Sunday in the room full stop. If it is, hi. Welcome. It's great to have you. If you're fairly new to this community, if you're new to faith, hopefully this will be a helpful moment when we can talk about who we are and how we think and why we do the things the way we do things around here. Hopefully it's helpful as a reminder for those of us who've been around for a while as well of the stuff that is important to us and the stuff that God has said to us over the years as he's formed us. Now, quick caveat before we go any further. Today is absolutely not a big pat on the back, aren't we wonderful, aren't we the perfect church moment. No, that's absolutely not what we're doing today. We like to think of ourselves as one big chunky vegetable in the beautiful church stew that is the church of Jesus Christ. We do what we do to represent Jesus in the world as best we can alongside all of the other churches in our county. And we do what we do as faithfully as we can. This is a moment for us who are currently leading the church, us guys, to talk about this church, to talk about what God has called us to do and who he has called us to be. So last week, as I say, Emily talked about the church and today the plan is to talk about this church. And so before we go any further, I thought it would be fun to hear from some of you guys. And so before we dive in, I just want you to turn to the people around you and answer me a really quick question. If you could describe your home in four words, four things that you want your home to be, what four things would they be? Now, maybe you're not living in your ideal home situation right now. Maybe you're sofa surfing or sleeping rough. If that's the case, maybe you could think about your ideal home. Like if you could live anywhere, what would that look like? So just take a couple of minutes with the people around you, have a quick discussion, and then I'm going to come around and I'm going to pass the microphone to you and I want to hear back from you. So four things. If you could describe your home in four words, what would those four things be? Go. Okay, let's hear from some of you guys then. Four words. You don't have to tell me all four. Some words. Let's start with my fan club over here. Is it okay if I call you my fan club? No? Okay, go on then. Four words to describe your home. What would you say? Colourful. Okay, good. Anything else? Food. Excellent. Cheap. Can I just clarify? Is that... Cheap? Well raised. The ideal home. Is your home made of food or is there food in your home? There's food in the home, so it's not like a Hansel and Gretel situation. Okay, good to know. Anybody else? What have we got? Put your hands up if you've got something to share. Yes. Dani said cosy. Ooh, cosy. Very good. Very good. Anything else? What have we got? Hospitable. Hospitable, very good. Yeah, yep, okay. Peaceful. Ah, peaceful. Very good, yep. So, I would really like to live in a house that isn't a supported living because it's really, really noisy and because I'm autistic it's driving me absolutely round the bend. So, I prefer something like my own kind of little space with like a lot quieter and a lot sort of more simple and cheaper. So, you're also on cheap, you're also on peaceful. Very good. Okay, what else have we got? Well, actually both James and myself were talking about community. A home that is for community and a home with really good food and a home with engaging conversations. Fantastic, very good. Okay. Somewhere that's safe. Safe, yes. These are all good. Anything on this side of the room? What have we got? Any of you guys? Yes. Warm. Warm is good. Anything else? Yes. I said sanctuary. Ooh, good word, good word. So, kind of got some words, warm, peaceful, sanctuary, cheap, food. It's all good, it's all good. So, today that's basically what we're going to be doing today. We're going to be talking about four things that we as a leaders team feel kind of describe our community, our home, both the community that we are as a church and the community that we aspire to be. So, I'm going to really quickly introduce just four characteristics that we feel just kind of express how we feel about our church. If we were going to say those four things about what we want this church to be. And then one of these lovely people is going to take some time to unpack that a little bit for us. They're going to be talking about how this part of our DNA works itself out in our community at the moment. They're going to be talking about some biblical and prophetic backing for why it's important to us. And they're going to talk about the ways that we can kind of imagine expressing that more in the future. And so, the four kind of Gloucestershire Vineyard Church characteristics we're going to be talking about today is that as a community we are gathered, we are, where am I? There we are, growing, grounded and going. So, that's gathered, growing, grounded and going. And we believe that God has called us as a community to be all of those four things and they all conveniently begin with G for Gloucestershire. So, isn't that great? It's worth saying that we don't think that we're different or special as a church to be called to these four things. Actually, we believe that these are four things that all churches are called to be. But there are a couple of ways that we express ourselves in these areas which are kind of more particular to this community and these guys are going to be unpacking that. And so, I've kind of laid a bit of a challenge down for these guys. I've said, these are the four areas. What I'd like you to do is come and bring a whole load of Bible, tell us about why we do what we do, envision us, and you've got to do it in like three minutes. So, these guys have got quite a challenge. So, we're going to be encouraging, aren't we? We're going to be kind of vocally encouraging too, aren't we? Yes, we are. So, if one of these guys says something you agree with, why don't you use your words to tell them, be like, yes, come on, I love it. And we'll give them a very small round of applause at the end. How does that sound? Okay, so Emily's going to go first. Emily's going to talk to us about being gathered. Everybody give her a very small round of applause. Very good. I think we even have a slide that might have the four things on it. Oh, there you go, and the next one. There we go. Look at that. Oh, that's nice. So, gathered. This is one of our core characteristics as a church. And this basically means that we are a community of people. Not simply a load of individuals who happen to be in the same place at the same time on a Sunday afternoon. Right at the beginning of the Bible, in the first book called Genesis, we read about God's creation and the first not good thing was that man was alone. Humans are created for community in all different shapes, forms, and sizes and inclusive of introverts and extroverts. But we are designed to work together, to require each other, to fill the earth and subdue it, as Genesis would say, together. And the church is the Jesus-shaped expression of this. Often called the body of Christ. In a book called 1 Corinthians 12 in the New Testament of the Bible, Paul, the guy who writes that book, writes this. The human body has many parts, but the many parts make up one whole body. And so it is with the body of Christ. If one part suffers, all the parts suffer with it. And if one part is honored, all the parts are glad. All of you together are Christ's body and each of you is a part of it. So humanity is designed for community and the church is designed to be a gathered community. We're designed to be functioning effectively as everyone together, rejoicing and suffering together. All of us thriving in who and how God has made us because we are attached to and enabled to by others who are doing the same. When we were praying for\n\nProve to the world that you are my disciples. And this is why we really value being together, being hospitable and welcoming to any and all who want to know more about following Jesus. Like, look around us, in what other environment do we get the PhD student and the school dropout praying together? In what other environment do we get the millionaire and the day-to-day survivalist having a piece of toast together? Where else does the new baby get 10 new grandparents and 50 aunties, uncles and cousins except here? If we want to know Jesus, if we want the world to know Jesus, we need to love one another as he loved us. And so we need to be together, we need to eat together and we need to know each other. And here at Gloucester Vineyard Church, we try and emulate that in a variety of ways. For example, we have home groups. These are wonderful places to be known, to be challenged, to do life with people, maybe even people who don't look or live like us. Every year we have our church weekend away. There's a whole weekend with a prime purpose of just being together, being community, sharing meals, laughs, woes together. Of course, we have these, our Sunday gatherings like this every week, coming together as one body. And we value and we make space for and accommodate genuine community over things like tea and toast, with games. We have discussion moments, we have tea and coffee as people come in. And so as we keep being church, I just want to have this on our radar and our intent, being a gathered people. Let us love one another like in a true Jesus-shaped love kind of way. Let's eat together, share together, talk together. Let's be vulnerable and safe together. Let's be honest and kind. Let's safeguard each other. Let's advocate for each other. Let's encourage each other, lovingly correct each other, because this is how Jesus loves us, right? Let our loving gathered community point to Jesus. I'm just going to finish this three minutes is what I'm going to tell you. I've just been talking for with a quote from the book of Hebrews where it says, let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope we affirm, for God can be trusted to keep his promise. Let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love and good works. And let us not neglect our meeting together as some people do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of his return is drawing near. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Emily. I do love my wife, but I said to her, it's got to be three minutes. And she's like, I will speak for as long as I want to. Thank you very much. Ryan, over to you. I'll speak for two minutes. Thanks, Emily. I want to speak about growing in shrinking time. No, the beautiful value, the second one is just around growth and growing at GVC. When we think of growth, there's so many ideas that come to mind. Social media kind of spews personal growth at us and emotional growth. Our podcasts are full of growth. But whilst that's great and whilst God wants us to grow personally, emotionally and spiritually, it's not just about our personal dreams, our desires. God has dreams for us that are bigger than ourselves. He has an abundant vision for the world and he sees us as part of that vision. And he loves and knows us and therefore wants us to know his will in flourishing. So the question is, what does Jesus in the Bible say about growth? And I know that this can even be complicated, right? Because, I mean, the Christian to-do list, praying and gathering together and meeting together and giving, just can be overwhelming. So how do we understand this as simple as possible? And the simplest version I've come up with is, am I connected with Jesus? John 15, 5 says, I'm the vine and you're the branches and if you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit and apart from me you can do nothing. The great part about this is that the remaining in him part is unique for all of us. We all find God's unique, sustainable will and rhythm for our lives. And this connection gets fostered in our hearts and in our minds from the inside out. I recall a word that I had for myself and I felt for the church a couple of years back and it was a picture of potatoes. And so the gardeners amongst us will know that potatoes grow underground and all you see are kind of the leaves and the shoots above ground and you don't know what's happening and you kind of just have to trust that growth is happening under there in the hidden and secret place. Until the harvest and then you see these wonderful potatoes. And I'm Irish and I love a french fry like anybody else. And I love a potato. And I just felt God say that it was going to be in the hidden places of our lives that God's going to grow GVC. The second aspect of our growth as Emily has alluded to is just being part of this body and how we join together to grow. God made it this way so that we actually need to rely on each other to live this abundant life that he's called us to. In Proverbs 27, 17 it says, as iron sharpens iron so one person sharpens another. So being part of this body at GVC is not just about coming to church or being on the hospitality team or serving or attending meetings but being joined together in that friendship, you know, that close bond that you form with the person next to you by helping, by giving to each other in various ways, calling each other into our own calling in God and asking how the Bible applies to our lives in this day and age, all towards Jesus, that we live deeply in his love. Now, we are not about, you know, creating a commune or cult, right? But this is really just an invitation to discover what Jesus is saying to all of us, to this exciting life that we're exploring together with God. So at GVC this looks like taking our next steps towards him in home groups and, you know, sharing our problems and our challenges, sharing our successes and our wins in a real way and just being honest with each other about where we are in our walks with God. Serving our city and our neighbors side by side and, you know, sometimes taking risks with and for each other. This place is a place of community and of friendship first as we grow together and towards Jesus. And that's really what growing here at GVC looks like. And I'm sure that was not two minutes. Thank you, Ryan. Give him a quick round of applause. Thanks, buddy. Okay, thirdly, let's talk about being grounded. What the heck does that mean? Diane, over to you. Grounded, it's awesome. The church is grounded. We are grounded on the foundation of our faith in who Jesus is as the King and Savior of the world, in the gift of God's word to us in the Bible, and in God's presence to us in the Spirit who lives in us and who works amongst us and who is at work in His world. So at GVC, we want to be grounded. We want to be grounded in God's word, in God's activity, and in being shaped by really good theology, which we know brings life. Now, who can get excited about some good theology? All right, all right. I heard a few. I heard a few there. Not sure? Who can get excited that we are all new creations, new people in Christ? There we go. That's some great theology. Who can get excited that we are made in the very image of God? That's some Genesis 1 action, right, that God has made us in His image and has given us the task of representing Him in the world. So good theology, let's hear it. So we are people of God's kingdom where we strive to live under the management of Jesus and bring that reality of God's kingdom more and more into this present time. And we want to be a community then where we preach and live out this amazing good news. To do that, we seek to let the Bible speak into our lives as we gather on a Sunday, as we meet in home groups, as we connect for coffee, prayer time, wherever we might connect. Now, sometimes wrestling with the Bible means that we also are a community where we strive to listen, we discuss, and sometimes even disagree well. That means that when we disagree, we want to do that in grace and in love. So we are not perfect. Yeah, I'll hear it for that. We're not perfect, and we're not the only church living out this life-giving reality of the kingdom. As Daniel said, all churches are bringing the same core commitments, and then every church brings some special sauce, right? A little ingredient to the stew. As a vineyard church, we are\n\npeople who want the Bible to be our plumb line. We want to seek God's kingdom in all its ways here, even while we recognize it's not going to be complete. We particularly value worship as a priority in the church. So at GVC, we are a worshiping community. We want to encounter God in our worship. And we want to lean into and look for the activity of the Holy Spirit because we believe that the Spirit is alive and well and at work here and now. And so we say, come and do your work, Holy Spirit, right? We want to be at Gloucester Vineyard Church, a church where everybody gets to play. That's a funny vineyard phrase. Everybody gets to play, right? That means that we believe that every believer is qualified for work in the kingdom. All are empowered by the Spirit for God's good work in the world and in the church, and that is regardless of your education, your background, your family circumstance, your age, your gender. At GVC, we particularly value the children among us as part of the church now. And we particularly want to empower women to fulfill their gifts in the church, to lead and to flourish as God has called and gifted them. In Luke's biography of Jesus, in chapter 4, Jesus says, the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released, that the blind will see, and that the oppressed will be set free, and that the time of the Lord's favor has come. Now that is some good news that we want to be grounded in and we want to share with others. Come on. You guys are very self-controlled. I was like, ooh, yeah, come on. That was very good. All right, Aaron, finish us off. Well done. Okay, here we go. Here we go. So my part of today's talk is about going, and I'm spinning off from two key Bible passages. The first is from Philippians chapter 2. Paul was writing to some Greek Christians when he said, have the same attitude in yourselves which was in Christ Jesus. Look to him as your example of selfless humility. He existed in the form and unchanging essence of God. Jesus was one with him, possessing the fullness of all the divine attributes. Yet he didn't regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, as if he didn't already possess it or he was afraid of losing it. He took the form of a servant and became completely human. I'm guessing Jesus was pretty darn comfortable in heaven. I could have thought, well, you know, life as God is good. I like it here, and Earth can be a pretty hard place. I'll just send some prophets and some visions and stuff, and hopefully they'll eventually get the idea and start doing the right things and loving me. Well, he could have, and he did that for a time. Yet John chapter 3 reminds us that because of his love, because of his love, Jesus left that place of comfort to experience alongside us a sometimes uncomfortable place that is life on this planet. Going, though, is a part of God's own plan, and he's going places. The second key Bible passage that I want to point to that emphasizes going is in Matthew chapter 28. Jesus is talking with his disciples, and he said, all power of absolute rule in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go and make disciples of all nations. Help people to learn of me, believe in me, and obey my words. Baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Teach them to observe everything that I have commanded you. I'm remaining with you as you do this, regardless of circumstance and on every occasion, even to the end of the age. If there were ever some famous last words that challenge us to be going, this is it. Jesus told his disciples, go and make disciples everywhere. The call to follow Jesus has not been, go and make some comfortable gatherings and hang out. It's always been about going and going beyond ourselves. So GVC is and wants to be, as we keep going forward, looking out and going out. God has given us hope, and it's too good to keep to ourselves. We live with open hands, willing to give of our time and our resources and our energy. We don't just talk about bringing hope and joy to Gloucestershire. We have to be willing to go and do it. And as we go, we invite people to join God's family. Going involves being hopeful in a hopeless world. When we serve, when we care, when we show up in kindness, we demonstrate the heart of Jesus. And the beautiful truth in God's kingdom, like Diane mentioned just a moment ago, everybody gets to play. Every single one of us has been invited to go, carrying his hope and his joy wherever we go. We also believe that going requires creativity. A couple hundred years ago, there were almshouses. What the heck was an almshouse? Well, that was established to provide for the poor and the elderly or others who couldn't support themselves. Nowadays, we do things differently. We have an English conversation group in Chai and Chat. We provide supplies for parents of infants in Grow Baby. We host adults caring for children in Vibes. And then there are clubs and groups that various folks are involved in through the week. So God has even given somebody in our church, a couple of folks in our church, a vision of going out with an ice cream truck and handing out free ice cream as a way of bringing joy into the city streets. Who knows what God may lead us to do next as we go? Who knows? But keep listening. So as we partner with Jesus, he leads us to multiply his church, creating new communities where people can encounter him. So going isn't optional. It's at the very heart of what it means to follow Jesus. So the questions are, where is God calling you? Where is God calling me to go? And the good news with that is that wherever we go, we know that Jesus goes with us and will help us every step of the way. You know you're in the right church when you get the biggest whoop of enthusiasm for ice cream truck, right? Like, yeah, talking about like kingdom of God and people being set free and people like, ice cream truck? Where's the ice cream truck? Anyway, okay, we've spoken for ages. Why don't you guys get back into those little groups really, really quickly and just discuss like which one of those four kind of stood out to you the most? Which one resonated for you the most? Maybe you get excited about being a kind of gathered community about hospitality, about being a family and creating an environment of belonging. Maybe it's about growing. Maybe discipleship is your thing. You want to see people healed and restored and released from stuff that's holding them back. Or maybe you're one of the Bible nerds amongst us who loves a bit of kingdom theology and wants to see the Holy Spirit ministering to people. Or maybe you want to go. Maybe you are excited about the idea of creating new communities and rolling up our sleeves and going and serving our neighbors. So just take literally two minutes. Chat to the people around you. We'll say goodbye to these guys. Give them a round of applause. Thank you. Two minutes and then we'll wrap it all up. Okie dokie. So before the kiddos come back in again and join us, just wanted to bring this thing into land. So a couple of weeks ago, my friend Steve grabbed me after church and said he'd been reading the last book of the Bible called The Revelation. Anybody ever read any of that? Interesting read, isn't it? Very interesting read. Not a book I've read an awful lot if I'm honest. But the book starts, if you've read it before, with Jesus basically sending a message to seven of the first churches. Basically giving them a report card. That's a terrifying prospect for someone like me. Can you imagine like Jesus giving us a report card on our church? It's just terrifying. And in some of these letters, Jesus is commending these churches for what they're doing and he's bringing some correction and challenge in other cases. And as I read these letters to some of the churches, it kind of percolated back into the top of my mind this week as I was preparing for today. And there's one report card in particular that got my attention. It's probably the best known of the seven. It's the last one. And it kind of sticks in the mind because it's got quite a funny mental picture associated with it. Let me read it to you. It's written to a church in a place called Laodicea. And Jesus says this, I know all of the things you do, that you are neither hot nor cold. I wish that you were one or the other. But since you are like lukewarm water, neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth. You say I'm rich and I have everything I want. I don't need a thing. And you don't realize that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked. That's nice, isn't it? Isn't that nice? Can you imagine Jesus handing you that on your report card? Like C for effort. Not a comforting thing to be told by Jesus. I'm sure they're all patting themselves on the back when they read that. But these verses have come back to me this week as I've been preparing this. Not because I think that God is necessarily saying that to us as a church, but because as Emily said last week, I think there is a real risk for our church or any church really. Last week, Emily talked about how easy it is for us to let the church fade into the background, for us to take the church for granted,\n\nto forget that the church is meant to be a revolutionary force. Did anyone else have a really convicting moment last week listening to Emily when she started talking about what the church is supposed to be like? And you're sitting there thinking, that doesn't describe my church. Anyone else have that moment? Oh, was it just me? Oh gosh, you guys are amazing. That was quite a convicting moment for me as one of the leaders of this church. Like, wow, that's amazing. That doesn't describe our church. It's okay. Now I've said that out loud, would anyone like to put their hand up and say, yeah, maybe a little bit in some ways? We do okay, we do okay. As I was preparing this, I really thought you'd react differently to that, I'm sorry. As I was preparing this week, I just really felt like God say, I want you to turn up the heat at Gloucester Vineyard Church. I want you to turn up the temperature on these four things. I felt like God say, this is the church that I've called you to be. I have not called you to be a church in the background. I have not called you to be a lukewarm church. I have not called you to be a church which plays its tune at half volume, who's a little bit hospitable when we feel like it, who quite likes kingdom theology or who kind of occasionally allows women to preach, or who sometimes goes and does some nice things in the community, or who kind of theoretically believe that miracles happen, but we never actually seek them. Who's too afraid of offending people to challenge injustice in the world. I felt like Jesus say, look out, watch out. I want you to guard against being lukewarm. Guard against being a community where we express these characteristics that we've been talking about as background noise. The church is not supposed to dwell in the background. We are supposed to be advancing into enemy territory with a confident declaration that Jesus is the king. Thank you. I'm gonna say that again. You're all supposed to say that. Where am I? Oh dear. It's been a long week. The church is not supposed to dwell in the background. We are supposed to be advancing into enemy territory with a confident declaration that Jesus is the king. That's much more like it. As I said earlier on, there is nothing special or new or innovative about the things that we've shared today. These are things that all churches are called to be and much, much more. But the reality is that we can express these things quietly and we will be a really nice community, or we can express these things at full volume and be a revolutionary force that Emily was talking about last week. We can be that revolutionary force that Jesus calls us to be. The question for us today is how loudly are we being these four things? How passionately are we these things? How fervently are we embodying these things? As a community, we are not called to be lukewarm. We are called to be on fire. We are an expression of the church of Jesus Christ. We are called to be invested in this city, to show up everywhere we go, to announce and demonstrate the good news of the arrival of the kingdom of God. We are called to be carriers of the kingdom. As Diane shared earlier on, we are called to proclaim freedom for the captives, recovery of sight for the blind, and to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. Gloucester Vineyard Church, we are not called to be a lukewarm church. Amen? We are called to be a church on fire for Jesus. Okay, this is who we are. Kiddos, welcome back. Sorry, you kind of came in and I was in the middle of a flow of thought there, but I appreciate you. You snuck in like little sneaky weasels. That was amazing. Welcome back. Why don't we celebrate communion together as we finish?"

    "transcript": "May I speak in the name of God, who is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Amen. Please be seated. When I used to work in the prison service, I came across a man called Michael, and Michael was doing 15 years for a crime he said he did not commit. Now, one thing you learn about when you work in a prison is they're all innocent. They all say they didn't do it. But prison is a place of despair, where there doesn't seem to be any hope and great fear. And Michael was very fearful in prison, and he was 6'4\". And I'm talking width, not height. But he was terrified to be out of his cell, especially in association time, which is when we used to have prisoners mixing with each other. And one of my jobs that I did when I was working in prison security is I had to do what was called a cell spin. In other words, I had to go in and we had to go and check cells for things like contraband, drugs, and weapons. And on this particular day, I had to do a cell spin on Michael's cell. And I went in there and I found that he had loads and loads of these. This is what's called a rosary bead hanging up on his cell window. And I said to Michael, I said, why have you got so many? How many of these have you got anyway? He said, I've got 33. I said, Michael, why have you got 33 rosary beads? Most Christians only need one. Why have you got 33? He said, I've got one for every year that Jesus was here on earth. And I'm beginning to understand that I need to look to the cross for hope. That I need to face my fears, but only by the help of Jesus Christ. See, the cross can mean many things to many people. And if we were back here in the time of Jesus, the idea of Holy Cross Day, which is what we are celebrating today, makes absolutely no sense. The cross was a sign of unspeakable pain and anguish. It was reserved for the worst criminals. No Roman citizen was allowed to be crucified. It was considered that barbaric. In most cases, it would take many hours for someone to die. It was public. It was horrendous. It was excruciating. But we fast forward now to 2025. What does the cross mean to us in our society? Well, it's also become like a fashion symbol. You'll find in the news that people are degrading the cross by not giving it its proper respect and reverence. In some parts of the world, it's illegal to show the cross, like in some Arabic countries. But in order to understand the cross, we have to unlock the Old Testament. And Jesus helps us to do this by referring to the story of Moses, which was in our Gospel reading. See, the Bible is full of links with Jesus, and this story of Moses is one of them. Moses had been leading the Israelites out of Egypt. They were in the desert. It seemed like it was a complete lost cause. And they started to complain to God. They wanted almost the good old days of slavery. Why can't we go back to Egypt? It was way better then. They thought they could be in a better situation than the one that they were in at the moment. How many of that is true for us at this time? So God sent poisonous snakes to bite them. And Moses asked God, he says, God, what do I do? I'm in this really difficult problem. I can't solve this. And God says, make yourself a bronze snake. Fix it onto a pole. And then when people are bitten by the snake, they need to look at it, and then they were cured. Now this might sound really strange. But what we have to understand is the symbolic nature of this story. Firstly, bronze was a material referencing judgment. It was God's righteous judgment on his people who were going away from him. And the snake was a symbol of evil and rebellion against God. You can read that in Genesis. But this is the direct link with Jesus on the cross. But Jesus was taking all the rebellion of our sin on himself in place of the snake on the pole. So we have the cross instead of that. And we need to look to the cross to be saved and have eternal life. And you notice when you come to this church, we've got two depictions of the cross. We've got the cross right above my head with Jesus who is crucified. But also, you'll notice we've got this cross over here behind me where Jesus is not on it. And this is showing that Jesus is alive. The cross was not the end. You might notice sometimes during church that I have to set the chalice up in a certain way. And one of the chalices you'll notice has got a crucifix at the bottom. And that's always meant to face the priest, the person who's presiding. And that's a reminder to people like myself and other people in this church that Jesus died for the clergy as well as everyone else. It's so important to remember. But the cross has always got to be in the center of our church because without the cross there is no hope. And a bit like Michael, we have lots of fears and worries in our life. And some of them are very small and some of them feel absolutely enormous. Now one of the things you've got to realize when you're going through vicar training is it's really, really hard. It's like The Apprentice 2.0. There is so much that's coming at you in terms of essays and the amount of work you have to do. And I remember a couple of years ago I had a really tough placement and I thought there's just no way I can carry on with this, God. This is far too difficult. Send someone else. And I remember sitting outside before I was about to go into a meeting with my supervisors about my progress and I was so worried about this placement report. And I sat on a bench and I cried. And I prayed, God, give me a sign that you can solve this. And when I lifted up my eyes, I honestly saw the biggest cross you have ever seen attached to the building. It definitely wasn't there when I got there, but it was there for me. And I began to realize that I need to focus my life on the cross and think about what Jesus wants for me. Now consequently, the replacement report did not carry as much weight as I thought. And I was allowed to continue my training, hence why I'm wearing a dog collar today. And some of us have got so much fear about telling people about Jesus. But maybe you've got a fear about the future. You don't know what to do next. You have a worry or concern in your life that just seems so big. You're like the people round by Moses. This is just impossible. I can't defeat all the snakes. It's just not doable. But God wants to help you in your fears and concerns today. And God wants to enter the messiness of our lives to help us in our situations. Do you know the phrase that turns up more times in the Bible than any other? It's fear not. I love that. I love that. That God says, don't worry. I can help you, but only if you let me. See, the Bible is absolutely full of people who were terrified and worried and didn't know what to do. You can read about people like Jonah. You can read about Gideon. You can read about Peter, who denied knowing Jesus. But in our gospel reading, Jesus is saying that I have come into the world to save it, not to condemn it. Now we can try every other type of self-help guide out there, but following God is the right way. The thing is, it's a conscious decision every day to want to follow Jesus. It's like going to the gym. It's a choice. It can be hard. It can be really difficult. I think praying can be one of the hardest things, even for someone like myself. So I have here, I have a small little holding cross, as you see here. And I find this is so helpful to hold on to when I'm doing my prayers. Perhaps you should go and get one. You can buy one of these online. They're quite cheap. They're not expensive.\n\nBut it reminds me that this is what my faith is all about. It's all about the cross. It's incredible to think that this instrument of torture is actually a symbol of being able to put all my fears and all my worries to Jesus. And this is why Jesus, I believe, mentioned about Moses. Because he was telling people that no matter how difficult your situation might be, God can be involved with it. Now I believe that there is a spiritual realm as well as a physical one. There is a battle of good versus evil. Hence I always try to look to the cross. Because what I know about Jesus is that his character never changes. But he is alive and he can help you. That is, if you want him to. Amen."
