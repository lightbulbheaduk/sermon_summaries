    "transcript": "Oh, thank you. So these guys are good friends and really smart people and really good to listen to. So I've invited these guys to come and talk to us and they'll tell us what they're going to talk about. But I'm just going to quickly pray for you and then you guys can plow in. So Lord, I thank you for Ben and for Diane. I thank you for the hearts that they have for you, the love they have for you and their track record with you as well. And we pray that you'd fill them afresh with your Holy Spirit as they speak to us. And we open our hearts to hear from you from what they have to share. In Jesus' name. Amen. Thanks, Daniel. So Daniel asked us to talk about giving this week. And so since British people find it awkward to talk about money, he's like, two Americans can do this. As they say, you know, in polite company never talks about religion and politics. And I think the reason why you're not allowed to talk about those is because both of them have to do with money. And one of these reasons actually is Protestants that we are hesitant to think about money and even perhaps the manipulation that comes with this is the whole reason the Protestant Reformation started or one of the main reasons was about how money was spent. So there were people buying bishop roles. So we have the new archbishop, right? So if you were wealthy, you could actually bid to buy the role like that. And actually one of the major things that started the Reformation was a capital campaign. The Catholic Church, the Pope was trying to build what is still today the largest church in the world, St. Peter's Basilica. And so it was an expensive venture. And one of the things that came out of that was the Pope didn't necessarily kind of advocate this directly, but in the German church there was a guy named Johann Tetzel who came up with a nice fundraising campaign to help encourage people to give money. They connected it with the idea of like if you're generous, then you wouldn't spend as much time in purgatory. And so this guy, Johann Tetzel, came up with a nice little jingle that anytime a coin in the box rings, a soul from purgatory springs. And so Martin Luther, his 99 theses or 95 theses were originally not against the Pope or anything else, but he was very much against this idea of using this way of using money to motivate people to give to the church and things like that. And so as Protestants, we have kind of brought this heritage that you shouldn't talk about money in church, right? Just let people do what they want to do. But you might remember a few months ago now, I guess, is when Emily preached about Acts 2 and has this list of the things that the church did. They devoted themselves to prayer, the apostles' teaching, and they gave to one another so that no one had any need. And so that this idea of giving is like one of the most core and central ideas about what it means to live the church and be in community together is to share. We're going to talk a lot about money here, but this isn't limited to money. Money is just one example of many, but it is something that the Bible talks about a lot. Jesus talked about money way more than he ever talked about hell or anything else like that. And so we're just giving attention to that. So part of our talk here is like our reticence to talk about money might come from our kind of communal heritage. We're also highly shaped by our family heritage. And so, Diane, I was going to ask you, what kind of views about money did you bring out of your family? Well, I consider myself really fortunate because I grew up in a Christian family that was very active in the church and really sought to live out and talked about the ways that they were enacting their faith. And one of those was giving. Certainly it was also quite a conservative Christian upbringing, and so we did talk about money. But that really was shaping to me because in my family we talked about God's generosity. We talked about giving as an act of worship, and we talked about then how our priorities were with our money. And then when things happened, we talked about that as well in light of faith. So when things were, yeah, all kinds of different financial situations. So I counted myself really blessed because that shaped me and gave me a basis on which to then move into my adult views of how giving works. How about you, Ben? Yeah, I grew up Baptist, and so they're one of the communities in the States that talks about like the tithe, the 10% is like the main thing. Like that's how you measure whether you're doing it right or not. So the tithe is just the, I guess, somewhere from a Hebrew word or maybe Latin, I don't know. But it goes back to Hebrew in the Old Testament that you would give 10% as the starting point. But you would have the tithes as the given, and then you would have offerings or the stuff that goes on top of that, so if there's other things. And so that kind of shaped my upbringing as like my faith heritage. My parents were actually quite, didn't always manage their money well, but they were generous people. So we would have people live with us at times, like my mother was a school teacher, and so we had one of her students that came and lived with us. I have two uncles that have had long-term disability issues that I know my parents have supported over many years now. And so in that sense of like there's this act of generosity to those that were not shaped or didn't have the means in the same way. And so it's that kind of a vision that has actually shaped my own call to ministry or what I worked with at the children's home. I've worked with transitional housing things and then even human trafficking, sex abuse outreach and things like this. But to those that didn't have as much in the way of this world's goods that God has called me specifically to help and serve in those ways. Well, let me ask you a question then. Is there a time in your life that giving was especially impactful to you? Well, there's been lots of times. I would say when we first got married, again, kind of bringing that idea of our foundation. When we first got married and we actually had our own very small bit of money enough to do beans on toast and that kind of thing. It was quite a blessing because Aaron also had grown up in a family that gave. And so for us, we could say, okay, here we are. We're starting our marriage. What is giving going to look like for us? And having had, you know, we were poor, newly married, very young people. But we said, okay, like we have had this testimony in our lives. And so we're going to go that way. We're going to give and it'll be the first thing that we give and we'll just trust God to make the rest all fine. And we have seen that over and over. And there have been a few times where, again, you know, stuff happens with your life circumstances or whatnot. And there's been one or two times in which we've gone, oh, you know, oh, you know, nope, nope. Think back of all the times God has provided. And so we've been able to then give and give and trust that God will provide still. So that's a giving kind of thing. The other side of giving is having generosity shown to you. And I think that's something that we're going to also talk about as we think about generosity. But here's a question for you all to turn to a neighbor. Tell a time or can you think of an example when someone's generosity has impacted you? Has there been a time that you can think of where someone's generosity, big thing, small thing, in any different kind of context, has been an impactful thing for you? We're going to give you just one minute. Turn to a little neighbor. GBC folks, help everybody feel included. Yeah, so the beautiful thing, there's so many stories of generosity of where we have needs. And other times they're not necessarily we have a need, but somebody just goes out of their way to bless you and to think about that. And so that's so much of what we're talking about here today is this idea of reciprocation, that we're part of this community and it's not always just someone giving, someone receiving, but we all have different ways. And so some of those things might have been financial. They might have been a gift of time. I know I moved, we moved house, I guess, about a year ago, and Aaron and one of their close family friends came and helped us move a large wardrobe. And it was like there's no way I could have done this on my own. And so it was just like\n\nTheir skills made all that. It was such a gift, you know. And so there's different ways that we can give and receive to one another. The one thing that we are thinking about here is like we're talking about giving. And so, of course, part of this is giving to the church. I don't think this is the only way that we give. But there is a question of like why would we give to the church? And Diane, I don't know, what do you think about giving to WTC? Or that, or that. Diane gives her time to WTC. We both work there together. And I have to fundraise for that too. So I can give you – I think there's good reasons why I can tell you that. Why do you give to GVC? Yeah, so why give to the church? I think there's many wonderful things to give to as well. But I think for me, particularly thinking about giving to the church, is critical in that if I belong to Jesus and I'm following him with all my life, I'm trying to shape who I am around following Jesus. And that includes how I give my time, how I give my money. And if I believe in the church being the body of Christ, being the hands and the feet of Jesus in the world, I want to invest as a priority into what the church and in our case this church is doing as are many, many churches, not just this church, but living out the call to mission that God's given us in the world. And so for me, that makes giving to the church part of a priority. There's lots of other reasons. Giving shapes our discipleship and many other kinds of things, but that's at least a starter of why give to church. Yeah, and if you're wondering what your money actually goes to in the church, we have a slide here. It's not as easy to read from far away. If you don't know, we have an annual presentation that about, I don't know, about what, three or four people show up to that Emily prepares diligently for. Does such a great job. It is literally the most exciting financial presentation I've seen in a church. It's colorful. Look at that. Bringing hope and joy to Gloucestershire. But as you'll see, the biggest part, and this is true in any church, in fact, we spend less on employees. It's usually around 55 to 60 percent is what an average church spends their time on is because we're in the people business. And so you hire people to give their time and energy to others. The other bit, is this mauve? I don't know what this color is on the bottom left. Fuchsia. Is for the venue hire. So it takes money to show up here and have the tea and toast place. We give. The blue part on the left is for us to give. You'll maybe know the heritage that the church started that giving a certain percent. I don't know if 10 percent was the original. That's right. And the goal is that we increase that as a percentage every year. So not just increase the amount that we give away, but that we're embodying generosity as a community. So I'll just say as a community, our giving is now we're seven years old and our giving is at 17 percent and it's set to go up again. So it's increased 1 percent a year since its inception. And so there's lots of things that that goes into. And then the rest is all the other things that are part of existing in the modern world. So paying professional services and things like this. So in this sense, as you may not know this, my first degree was in accounting. And so for years I've done finance work. This is all very standard for a church. And in fact, it's the giving percentage of our church back, the Sugar Land Vineyard, is much less than this. And so it's not that it's all being absorbed. And I know in this sense, like Daniel and Emily volunteer. If we paid them an hourly rate, it would be probably ridiculously small because I know they do more work than what they're paid for. So in that sense, I as a giver don't have any hesitation that my money is being poorly spent here. So one of the things we like to talk about is looking at the Bible and maybe just chatting through some biblical passages that are formative. Do you want to do the Genesis one there first? I'm number one. Yeah. So you might think, oh, where would you look in the Bible for giving? And one of the things I love about thinking about giving is from Genesis 1 and 2. So right back at the beginning of the Bible, the creation story. And when God made people, he made creation. It's amazing. It's a place of abundance. There is enough. And sometimes I think we think, oh, man, we're living in scarcity. Creation is a place of abundance and enough. And then God gave people the charge, the job to steward what God had made. He gave us responsibility for it and said, make something of it. Steward this world that I've given you to cultivate it. And so actually, I think giving starts with this. One of the threads is that we are stewarding what God has entrusted to us. And that is a personal thing. Everything that I have, my life and my junk, my stuff, my money, it's all God's. He's entrusted it to me to steward well. And so part of what I'm doing when I'm thinking about giving is going back to that charge and job that I've been giving to steward in the well. And that includes my giving. So it all belongs to God, and I'm giving back from that. And it's out of that then that the Old Testament talks about the 10%. If you're actually interested in this, it isn't just 10% in the Old Testament. It's 10% on an annual basis, but then there are certain years when you give even more than just that. So you would pay for not just your own tithes and offerings. The Deuteronomy 14 is if you want to get into that. I was thinking about Matthew 6 is the passage that is one that some may be familiar with. It says, when you give, don't trumpet it to the rest on the streets that you're giving. In fact, you should give in a way that your right hand doesn't know what your left hand is doing. And so sometimes we're like, well, this is why we should never talk about money then. It's like I shouldn't even have a sense of what's going on somewhere else. But he also puts this in the same conversation of praying. And we don't have any problem. He says, now don't let your prayers be trumpeted out to where everybody sees them so that you're doing it for show. The whole idea is let it be out of motivation from your heart, not for something that you receive back. And we see this in the rest of Matthew 6 as well too. And later in the chapter, Jesus says, now don't worry about what you're going to wear, what you're going to eat, because God will provide these things in the same way that he provides for the animals of the field. In fact, he says, seek first the kingdom of God because that's where your treasure is. That's where your heart will be also. And so let your treasures be invested in the kingdom. And again, it's not that the church itself is where the kingdom only is. God's doing all sorts of things. But that is one thing. And one of the things that's interesting to me about Matthew 6 is that he talks early about praying, so you're giving up your time in prayer. And giving, you're giving up your money, right, and giving or resources. But then he also talks about fasting and so giving up food. These are the big discipleship markers. And what he's saying is live your life with an open hand. Don't grasp after these things. And I think actually that's what leads into not having anxiety about these things. If you live your life with an open hand, then you're not anxious when they come and go. Because as you were saying, like God's the owner of this. We're just renters. We're letting his space that he's sharing with us in this. The thing I love from that, it helps me remember where is my security. Where is my security? It's not in my bank balance or it's not in the stuff that I have or the positions I might have or any of those things. And if we can hold our security and our identity with Christ in who he is and in his goodness, then it allows us that open-handedness. And it helps us to reshape those priorities. Yeah. Brilliant. So there's a couple other passages, 2 Corinthians 8. Let me grab that. Might have a couple verses there. I can't read them. I can't see them.\n\n2 Corinthians 8. Well, I've got it in different versions. It says, They are being tested by many troubles and they are very poor, but they are also filled with abundant joy, which has overflowed in rich generosity. And so then verse 8. 9. Okay, 9. You know the generous grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor so that by his poverty he could make you rich. And so this contrast here of rich and poor and the language that is being used here. Here is a giving passage here is Paul speaking to people who are giving. They're giving to a church that has need. And he's saying, yes, though you were poor, you were generous. But it comes first from Christ. Christ was poor and yet gave. And actually, God's grace that we see in Christ is the most generous act we could ever imagine. God's generosity to us sets the standard and enables us to then return back generosity. What do you think about that passage? Yeah, just that first verse. Oftentimes we think, oh, I don't have much to give. And he's using the example of people that didn't have a lot of financial resources. And so part of their giving was financial, but there are all different ways that we can give. I think some of us have all different gifts. I think about spiritual gifts here, for instance. If you're a believer and the spirit is in you, then you have a gift to share with other people. And so that might be encouragement, teaching, mercy. Giving is one of those. Faith. There's all these things that we have to give. Maybe you have just a seat in your lounge that somebody else could sit in for a cup of tea. Right? I mean, there's all these different things. It turns out I learned that I have the gift of a southern accent. You may not be thinking like, oh, what is my gift? It's like, well, people, for whatever reason here in Texas, they don't find my accent. In fact, it helps them go to sleep, I think. Maybe it's a gift in that way. But here it's interesting. It's different, right? And so we all have something whether we think we know it or not. And I think that's with the Macedonians here. There's actually two whole chapters in 2 Corinthians about giving. So this was from chapter 8. There's another one in chapter 9. And this is one that sometimes makes us a bit nervous. Verse 6 there says, whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. And whoever sows generously will reap generously. And this is interesting. Sometimes maybe you've heard of the prosperity gospel, that if you live right and you believe right, prosperity is going to come back to you. And so we're a bit nervous with that because like, well, suffering happens and sickness and things. But I think sometimes we swing the pendulum too far in the correction. It's like, no, if you go on to verse 11 there, it says, you'll be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion. And through us, your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God. And so in this sense, if God's saying like, he's going to provide our needs. And so the more generous we are, actually oftentimes God will give us more to be generous with. And so in that sense then, it's not so much that it comes back to us, that this moreness is for us just to live a nicer life or something. But God does invest resources in people that use them for the kingdom. And so in that sense, I think part of this is we just think about what are ways that we can step out that would be generous. I mean, it's one of those questions I think between these two chapters that sticks out to me is like, would somebody accuse you of being a generous person? So often we're thinking about percentages and 10%, whether that's right or wrong. And I think it's a good starting point myself. I'm of the opinion that if God says something in the Old Testament, it doesn't just automatically go away when we come to the New Testament. He has all other ethical commands that we think are very important out of the Old Testament. And so we don't have any problem following those. And the 10% is never repeated in the New Testament, so people will debate about that. But the question about generosity is like, would somebody accuse you of being generous? That's what Paul's argument here is. And I think in that sense, there are things that are easier for us to be generous with. It just so happens Heather and I are at a time of life with our kids are out of the house. It's easier for us to be generous with our money than it is to be with our time right now because of the transition we have. There are other seasons of life when you have a lot more time and you don't have money or whatever it is. The question is, it's not always what it is, but how are you allowing God to use you in that? We'll hold it at the end, if you will. There you go. I think it really speaks to attitudes too, doesn't it? Both of these passages and it helps us remember, you know, God loves a cheerful giver. The idea of giving, Paul talks in both of these chapters about giving generously, but giving joyfully. Giving with confidence. Giving because it's not from obligation. It's not from guilt. It's giving that open-handed kind of thing. And that is a wonderful thing to help us say, actually, how can I give? How can I come before the Lord? And if I can't give joyfully, there's something I can think about. Maybe I need to do some conversation with the Lord and say, what is it inside that makes me, is it fear? Am I fearful to give? Is there a narrative around us in our society that I've bought into and that makes me fearful to give? So giving attitudes, Scripture is really concerned about how we give in our hearts. I think we're at time here. We're close. I'm going to, if you have any final things to say. Well, if we get really practical, like how does planning for giving affect the rest of budgeting and spending in your experience? Yeah, I think in this sense for us, it's not living with 100% of our budget in this sense. Part of this is so that we have the flexibility when somebody has need around us to give. If we're spending 100% and even on good and right things, that means there's nothing left there. There's no margin there. And so just trying to live a step back from where the margin, so there's always margin in our budget is something that Heather and I. And God's calling the first 15 years of our marriage, we lived off of one salary. And so it trained our kind of wants and needs to be. And when we moved here, one of the things was like, well, we can't move all of our junk across the ocean. And so let's go through the calling process and got rid of about 85% of our stuff. And part of this is like our lives are just driven by stuff. And I think it's healthy at different points to be like, just set a marker and say like, let's have a real accounting here. What do I really need? And what am I just dragging with me? And actually, what is keeping up with all that stuff actually takes more time and energy. And so it just frees up the ability to be more generous with your resources. I would say if giving is something that you are just thinking about or maybe you're reconsidering or you haven't ever thought about, my encouragement would be pray and ask the Lord to give you a starting point. Start somewhere. Give regularly, like plan it. It helps form us when we're giving regularly because it becomes then setting a priority and it shapes who we are and allows God to shape us. So start somewhere. And then in our habit is, yeah, reconsider and think, am I giving generously? Yeah. Here we go. And as we were finishing here, so we'll hand over. But one of the things as we come to the table here to celebrate communion, one of the things is celebrating God's abundance. His grace is enough. And so the whole idea is not to give out of emptiness or try to scrape something together. It's to recognize that God has given all of us great things through Christ and through our individual gifts as well. And so as you come to the table, think about God's generosity that he gives us, even the gifts we don't deserve, but use that also as a challenge to consider how you might use that grace that he has given you. Amen. Amen."

It's fabulous to see you all this afternoon. Who wants to see some pictures of my dog? Yay! Let's look at some pictures. So here we go. Here's Ralph. This is my dog Ralph. Isn't he cute? This is him asleep. This is his favourite posture. This is him scratching the paintwork on the side of my car. Thanks, Ralph. More pictures of him when he was a puppy. Isn't he cute? Never quite that cute again. Here he is. This is him now. He's very fast. Lovely. Dog fans in the room? Dog people? Cat people? Oh, change your minds. Goodness sake. Here he is. Look at him. He's so cute. Look at his nose. I'm just going to skip ahead a little bit because there's just more of the same. There we go. There's Ralph. I'm going to leave him up there because he's very sweet. So that's my dog. He's lovely. He's very gentle. He's very easy. He's very sleepy. Now they do say that a dog is a man's best friend. Can I just make it very clear that this dog is not my best friend? There are some days when I don't even like this dog at all. He is a massive pain in the neck. Before we got Ralph, we did some research into what kind of dog we would like to get. We found that Whippets... Ralph is kind of Whippet plus. There's Whippet plus some more in there. But Whippets in generally, they've got lots of the characteristics that we're looking for in a dog. So they don't shed much. They don't smell much. They don't bark much. They don't eat much. Generally speaking, very easy dogs that make great companions. But there was one thing on the website when we were looking and doing our research that Emily and I chose to ignore. And now we regret. On the website it said, Whippets are very willful. Whippets are very willful. So they basically, they're very, very difficult to train. Because if they don't want to do something, they're not going to be doing it. So for example, if we go to the park and Ralph decides that he wants to go over there and eat another dog's business, he was going to go and do that. And there's just nothing I can do about it. Or if he wants to go and introduce himself very enthusiastically to another small fluffy defenseless dog, he is going to go and do that. And no amount of shouting or cajoling from me is going to get him back again. So my experience of owning a dog, as lovely as this one is, is that when our wills are aligned, when what he wants is what I want, we have a great time. When he wants to have a cuddle on the sofa, when we want to play, there's just nothing like having a dog. But in those moments, and other dog owners will testify, when my will and Ralph's will are opposed, it's not fun for any of us. Any other dog owners in the room? Are we agreeing? Yes, it is the worst. And that has got me thinking a little bit about how we relate to God. Because wherever we are on our journey of faith, if we've been following him forever, or if we're still making up our minds, we will all have moments where we will find our will and God's will misaligned. Maybe we've been reading our Bibles, maybe we've been going to home group, coming along to church, maybe we've bumped into some Christian content on TikTok, or we've been listening to some podcasts, or spending quality time with Jesus, talking to a wise friend. Whatever it is, we suddenly find ourselves convicted that there's something about my life, there's something about what I want, that is somehow at odds with what God wants. And somehow, our wills are misaligned. Maybe it's something about being drawn out of our comfort zone, maybe it's kind of being convicted about being kind to that person I really dislike. Maybe it's simply being asked to wait for something that is good to happen. In those moments, we've got a choice, haven't we? We can ignore that very uncomfortable convicting feeling, or we can just crack on and spend some time thinking about it. How many of us know that when we ignore those convicting feelings, they just get bigger and bigger? Anybody ever has that experience? Yes! Thank goodness I'm not alone. So just like my relationship with Ralph, just like my relationship with the dog, it's true that when my will and God's will are aligned, it's the best thing in the world. There's just nothing like it. But when I know that for some reason my will and God's will are out of alignment, it makes our relationship really tricky. Now this is something which happens all the time to followers of Jesus. It's not uncommon or unusual at all to find ourselves in a moment when we're aware that our wills are misaligned. Does anybody here know what I'm talking about? Anybody have this experience? Put your hand up if you had. Seen some nods? Yeah, okay, so generally speaking, kind of, there's some agreement in the room. Or it might be that this dynamic is actually the very thing that's standing in the way of us crossing the line and saying a big yes to Jesus and becoming a Christian in the first place. It might be that we actually sense that saying yes to Jesus would mean bringing some of the things in our life into line with how God looks at the world and how God thinks our lives should run and the way we live them. That in order to follow Jesus with total integrity, some of the things in my life might have to change. Now that is totally natural and normal and an honest place to find ourselves. This experience is a continuous characteristic of following Jesus. We should expect to be in this place all the time. There was this famous German theologian during the Second World War called Dietrich Bonhoeffer. And he said this, we must be ready to allow ourselves to be interrupted by God. God will be constantly crossing our paths and cancelling our plans. One of my favourite psalms ever, it ends with this really scary moment of prayer, Psalm 139. And the scary moment of prayer says this, search me, O God, and know my heart. Test me and know my anxious thoughts. This is the scary bit. Point out anything in me that offends you and lead me along the path of everlasting life. How many of us know that God loves to answer that prayer? Guys, this is what it means to give our lives to Jesus. This is what it means to be a follower of Jesus, to call ourselves a Christian. We should be having this experience all the time. Because if we're living a life where what I want and what God wants is always perfectly aligned, if we're never having the experience of finding ourselves out of alignment with him, we're either like unicorn level follower of Jesus and you should really be up here preaching, or can I suggest that maybe we're not allowing God to speak into our lives at all? May I be so bold to say that if we're going through life and there are no areas of our thought life, none of our actions, nothing about how we spend our time, our energy, our money, nothing about how we express ourselves sexually or how we speak to others that is coming into conflict with how God would have us conduct ourselves in those spaces, may I be so bold as to say that maybe we haven't given our lives to Jesus? Or we're actually not necessarily following him? Or maybe we haven't submitted ourselves in any meaningful way to him? Let me give you a small, medium and large example and then I'd love to hear from some examples from you. So for me, every single day I wake up, hallelujah, and I don't want to get out of bed. And it might be that God wants to spend a bit of time with me before I start the day, but I don't want to get out of bed. So our wills are just a little bit misaligned. Or let me give you another one. Maybe I make a new friend and one of the first things this new friend says to me is that their shoulder hurts today. It might be that God wants me to pray for that person to be healed. But I've just made this friend. I don't want them to think I'm really weird. I want to make a good first impression. I'm like, the weirdness can come later. Like, our wills are misaligned, right? Anybody ever been in that situation? Or maybe I'm faced with the opportunity to live with and sleep with my partner before we're married. Now, it might be that we become aware that God might actually want us to wait for marriage before we cross that line. But that's not what I want, for like a million reasons. Like, our wills are misaligned. So I've given you three little examples. What I want you guys to do now is to break into little groups with those people around you and just have a little discussion. Can you think of any ideas, any other examples of times when our wills, common examples when our wills and God's will might be different from one another? They can be big or little. They can be silly or sensible. I'd love to hear your feedback afterwards. So get into those little groups and just for a couple of minutes have a little discussion and then I'm going to ask for some feedback. Okay, you ready? On your marks, get set, go. Okay, let's hear some of your examples. So have you guys got anything to say? Yes, youth home group. Praise silence for the youth home group. Here comes some wisdom. So a moment where our wills and God's will might be a little bit misaligned. Similar to one of yours where you have a friend or you've just made a new friend and you want to\n\nYou have anyone else get the impression that God's like, hi, I'm over here. And we're like, just give me a minute. Give me a minute. That's a really interesting reel. Have you remembered? Yeah. So the other thing is, I quite often, especially when I'm like with my other friends from, shall we say, the other side of things, it's difficult to explain. But basically, I have a lot of friends who definitely don't really know Christianity as well. Some of them are highly skeptical of it and everything else. And sometimes it's difficult, isn't it, to sort of like balance how do you do the right Christian thing without really cheesing off people that aren't remotely interested? Yeah, so when you're kind of hanging around with your other friends and there's other forces and other voices in the room, it's very difficult, isn't it? Okay, guys, thank you. Appreciate that. Okay. Where am I on this? Here, great. So the question I want to ask today is, thank you, Chez, by the way, for doing that. What should we do, doom scrolling, what should we do in these moments? What should our response be when we find ourselves in this place? Because as I've said, this is an essential, ordinary, natural, and built-in part of what it means to be a follower of Jesus. The reality is that this is both the way in and the way on in the kingdom of God. But I also wanted to talk about this today because as a church, we are going to be launching a new expression of this church in the north of the city early next year. And whilst that's a very good and exciting thing, the reality is that doing that step, kind of making that step is going to come at a cost. And whenever there's any kind of a cost to pay, whether it's buying crisps at the supermarket or buying your house, the thought runs through my head of, do I really want to pay that cost? That's going to cost me personally. And so these moments are either motivated by big, exciting news or simply as part of our day-to-day walk with Jesus, and moments when our wills and His will can be misaligned. They are uncomfortable moments and difficult moments. They can be moments when our relationship feel like they're under strain. And I think how we respond in those moments is really, really important. Because I believe that those moments are actually opportunities when we can become most fully alive. Those are the moments when we can actually step into our full humanity in an amazing way. And so today, with whatever time we've got left before the kids come rampaging back in again, I want to just take us on a little journey. We're going to read a couple of stories. We're going to get a little bit theological, a little bit philosophical, and hopefully we're going to end up really practical. How does that sound? Great. There's a couple of mmm's in the room. We like those. So the first thing I want to observe today is something that, frankly, I find totally bonkers. And I don't know if I'm ever really going to get my head around it. And to get there, I just want to ask a really quick question. Thinking about the world around us, everything that we see in the headlines, everything that we see in the world right now, here's my question. Do we see God's will being done in the world? Thinking about everything that goes on, do we see God's will being done in the world? All of the stuff right now? I think I would agree. And if we could put a percentage on it, what percentage would we say is like God's will on earth and what percentage is? 10, 20? Yeah, I'm with you, Paul. I really am. What about you guys? And so I'm just going to kind of go over here. Does anybody here think that 100% of what happens in the world today is the way that God would have it? That's a relief because that would have been a see-me-after-class moment and we would have had a conversation. That would have been fun, wouldn't it? What about like 90%, 80%? Shove your hand up when we're there. 70, 60, 50. Oh, we've got some 50s. Okay, yeah. 40, 30, 20, 10, 0. Nobody's zero, but there was a handful of 10s. Okay, let's just make it just slightly more personal for a second. Don't worry, I'm not going to ask you to raise a hand. But just have a little bit of a think. In our personal lives, what percentage of our lives would we say are in line with the way that God wants us to live our lives? I said don't say anything. Thank you. Although I appreciate it, thank you. Just take a little minute to think. What percentage of our lives, the thing that we have the most control over, would we say is in line with the way that God would have us live them? I'm going to take an educated guess here and say that none of us are peaking at 100. I mean, Paul is 80, 90 over here. So if you are, come and talk to Paul because he's near where you are. For me, I would definitely be like sub 50%. And that's not just me being overcritical. Whilst we're in this moment of self-reflection, why don't we just try to identify at least one way that this dynamic of being out of sync, misaligned with God's will, is playing out in our lives right now. Again, I'm not going to ask you for feedback, but just in this moment of self-reflection, let's just think. Can you think of a way right now that you're feeling convicted that maybe one of the ways I'm thinking, one of the ways I'm acting, something about our relationship, we're just out of alignment. Just take literally 10 seconds to think. Okay. So I'm sure that we can agree that to a great extent, we are living in a world which is outside of God's will. Things are not 100% the way that God would have them. Even when we think about our lives, the things over which we have the most control, we've just mentally admitted that none of us would say our lives are 100% in line with how God would have us live them. And this isn't a moment to beat ourselves up or give ourselves a hard time. It's just to observe that this is clearly the case. And this is the thing that I find completely bonkers. It's that we live in a world that God has created where he says to us as humanity, may your will be done on earth. Bear with me. I am going to unpack that. We live in a world that God has created where he says, may your will be done on earth. Look at the world around us. Look at our lives. We are living in the consequences of what happens when our will is allowed to be done on earth. It is extraordinary but true. God has given us an amazing world to live in. He's asked us to rule it. And he set it up in such a way that we as humans, we have real agency. We can make real decisions which have real consequences and real impacts. You know, God could have set things up completely differently. We could be pre-programmed robots where every action and decision is predetermined. That's clearly not the case. We could be his puppets where he kind of controls our every move in real time. That is clearly not the case either. No, God in his amazing and bonkers generosity has set things up in such a way that we have a genuine choice. We have a will and we get to express that will in our lives and on the earth. And we get to see our actions and our choices play out. Ron, can I give you that? It's gone dead on me. And I think it just needs to be unlocked. Sorry, thank you. Failure of multitasking. That didn't work. We see this extraordinary dynamic established in the opening pages of our Bible. Thank you, my friend. We meet two characters, Adam and Eve. They're set up in a beautiful garden. They're given everything they could ever need. And they're given a will. They're given the choice and the opportunity to express their will in the world. Let's have a read, shall we? So we're in the opening chapters of our Bibles and we read this wonderful narrative about how God created the world where humans can live and thrive. How God made everything up there and everything down here. Everything visible and everything invisible. Everything physical and spiritual. And what God immediately does for humanity is he gives them a job. And then he gives them a choice. He gives them a purpose and then he gives them a will. So we read this in the opening pages of our Bibles. Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and govern it. Reign over the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and all the animals that scurry along the ground. So that's our job description. Go everywhere and rule the earth on God's behalf. Sweet. But then God gives them a choice because governing the world on God's behalf is going to be tricky. We're going to need some help with that. We're going to need some knowledge. We're going to need some wisdom. We're going to need some sense of good and bad, some sense of right and wrong. We're going to need to get that framework from somewhere. And so God then presents humanity with a choice. He presents them with their will. And we read this. This multitasking thing is a bad idea. I apologize. I shouldn't have done this. We read this. The Lord God placed the man in the Garden of Eden. Yeah, thanks, Ron. I appreciate you. To tend and watch over it. But the Lord God warned him, you may freely eat the fruit of every tree in the\n\nWell, you're going to need knowledge, you're going to need wisdom, you're going to need a sense of good and bad, right and wrong. He's basically saying, how are you going to get the wisdom and the understanding to know how to do the things that I've asked you to do? Are you going to do it alongside me, the way I've designed it, in a loving relationship? Or are you going to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and bad? I.e., are you going to make those decisions for yourself outside of our loving relationship with me? This is the first classic moment of God's will and our will coming into conflict. This is the very first time where we see that bonkers dynamic that I talked about earlier on coming into play. God has passed over the authority of managing this world to us humans and said, whatever you decide, it will be done. He has said to us, may your will be done on earth. This isn't to say that God isn't involved in the ongoing running of the world or that he never intervenes. I'm not saying that at all, but we can clearly see that this is the way that our world works, can't we? If we want to create a world driven by greed, where we scourge the planet and the environment in order to make a profit, then clearly we have the will to do that. If we want to create societies where men are dominant over women and women are treated like objects of property, we clearly have the ability and the will to do that. If we want to create a world where people's value is defined by the color of their skin or their geographic location where they were born, we clearly have the ability to do that. May our wills be done. As bonkers as it is to admit, God has given us a world in which he repeatedly says to us, may your will be done on earth. And just look at what we've done with the place. We are all living in the consequences of humanity misusing the generous gift that God has given us. We see it writ large in our world and the politics around us on the news, and we see it writ small in our lives where we find ourselves able to self-sabotage, throw our lives away and do stupid things, make stupid decisions and squander our own happiness and our futures. May our wills be done in our lives and in the world. So I want to take a really quick, this is a really depressing moment, isn't it? I'm really sorry. Don't worry, we're going to go like this. It's going to be fine. Let's just take another really quick moment of discussion with those around you. I'm not structured at all, but I just want to give you a moment to respond. Pause and reflect. Maybe you agree with something I've just said. Maybe you disagree with something I've just said. Maybe you're smart and you want to add some nuance to something I've just said. This is a moment to do that. So I'm just going to give you one minute to just kind of brain dump with those around you, and then we're going to come back and hopefully go like this. Okay, you ready? Go. Okay. So what do we do? Where do we go from here? When we look around, we can see that God has given us an extraordinary gift of a beautiful world to live in, that he's granted us the dignity of a will to decide where we're going to go with it. But we've also somewhat painfully highlighted that when we relentlessly pursue what we want in the world, when we define good and evil for ourselves, when we find ourselves stood at the tree with a choice of following God's wisdom or choosing our own way, when we find our wills misaligned, and when what we want is not what God wants, when we find ourselves in that place and we choose our will, things often end in a mess. If we're honest and we do a little bit of a life audit, it doesn't take us long to think of examples of times when we've gone our own way and we've made a bit of a mess. Moments of regret when we wish we'd come into alignment with God's will for our lives sooner. Personally, just like my friend Chris shared earlier on, part of my journey has been about battling addiction. And one of the things that I've learned is that the longer I stay in what I want, the harder it is to move myself into what God wants for me. I also mentioned earlier about the idea of God wanting us to wait until we're married to live with and sleep with each other as a powerful witness to the world about the power and beauty of sex and the kind of prophetic significance of marriage. That was a big part of my journey and Emily's journey too. When Em and I were dating, we were dating and engaged for a really long time before we eventually got married and moved in together. And believe me, we wanted to, you know, get on with it. It was extremely difficult to align our wills to God's in that moment. And there were plenty of moments when we messed up and just pursued what we wanted. Like, I get it. And just look at the board that I accidentally just got rid of. Look at it anyway. It's over there. Those are the things that we've identified as areas where we experience this misalignment of will. So what do we do? How do we respond when we find ourselves in that moment? When we become convinced that actually when we always get what we want, it's not necessarily the best for us or the world. What do we do? Well, I want to go back into our Bibles and look at another man. We're going to visit another garden. And we find this man standing next to another tree and again being confronted with a battle of wills, being confronted with what God wants for his life and for the world and what he and his humanity wants. And what we see in this moment, rather than what Adam did, which was to choose his will, this guy surrenders his will and says, not my will, but yours be done. We observe this scene in the garden with a man who's confronted with a hugely painful moment of his will and God's will being misaligned. This guy, he is so anguished with the clash of wills that he's experienced that he says, my soul is crushed with grief to the point of death. And he goes on to say, if it's possible, let this choice be taken away from me. Let this cup of suffering be taken away from me. In other words, if there's another way that we can do this, please, can we do it that way? He's saying, I cannot face what you're asking me to do. He goes on and prays through the night and eventually he reaches a place in his prayers where his prayer shifts and he prays, if this cup cannot be taken away unless I drink it, then your will be done. In a moment of extraordinary humility and honesty, he says, if there's no other way for this to be done, then I choose your way and not my way. Did you catch the way he said it? He said, may your will be done. Earlier on he said it too. He said, I want your will to be done, not mine. Clearly this is that moment that we've been looking at today. This is the moment where my will and God's will are not aligned. The moment where something's got to give. The moment where I've been given a choice. I can walk away, I can walk my way, or I can choose to walk God's way. And this is perhaps the most epic clash of wills in the history of the universe because the person in this garden is Jesus. The person who's praying those prayers is Jesus. The person saying, I want your will to be done, not mine, is Jesus. In this moment we see Jesus as our brother. We see him as one of us, as fully human, as a human being just like you and me. When faced with difficult things, when faced with costly things, he has a real and honest and human reaction. We are allowed, we are permitted that glimpse of Jesus in weakness, where he says what we say. He says, God, I know what you want, but I don't want that. It's an astounding moment of authenticity that we're allowed to witness here. This is Jesus the human. This is Jesus our brother. And yet on the heels of this moment of vulnerability and authenticity, of this moment of almost pure humanity, Jesus shows us what it means to be truly human. He shows us what it means to be truly alive. Jesus demonstrates for us what it means to be human when he turns to the Father and says seven words, not my will, but yours be done. Not my will, but yours be done. And let's just remind ourselves quickly what was going on here. Let's remind ourselves of what Jesus was being asked to do because he wasn't being asked to just kind of give a bit of money to the undies fund. He wasn't being asked to risk his reputation by going and praying for that person. He wasn't being asked to speak with more compassion towards that person that he dislikes. He was being asked to go to the cross. He was being asked to be arrested, beaten, mocked, tortured and crucified, to be killed as a criminal, to be abandoned by his friends. But more than that, he knew that the path ahead of him would lead beyond death into the depths of hell itself to deliver a death blow to death. He was being asked to somehow have an experience of being abandoned by God, to experience separation from the Father for the first time. And yet in the face of that cost, Jesus, our brother and our example said, not my will, but yours be done. Some of us might have been raised to know the Lord's Prayer. We might remember this little phrase. It finds its way in there, doesn't it? This prayer, Jesus would have expected us to pray this daily. It says, our Father in heaven, may your name\n\nmotivated by love and generosity says to us, may your will be done on earth. And where we, motivated by love and gratitude, are invited to reply, no, not my will, but yours be done. To find ourselves in that reciprocal dance with our creator is to know what it is to be fully human. It's to find ourselves back in the garden at the tree and to choose a relationship with him over going our own way. To be a follower of Jesus is to pray each day, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth and in my life as it is in heaven. And to take that board of stuff that we identified earlier on and to say, no, Lord, not my will, but yours be done. Amen."

Last week, Emily talked a bit about what it means to be a church kind of at a foundational level, kind of church with a capital C. What is a church? And next week, we're going to be sharing, taking a moment to share about what we feel God is calling us onto in the coming years. But this week, we just wanted to take a chance to zoom in and pay a bit of attention to the church that God has called us to be. Talk a bit about our values and our DNA as a church to identify a few really kind of core and important things about who we are as a community, as Gloucester Vineyard Church, who God has called us to be. And we do this once a year for a couple of reasons. One of them is that for some of us in the room, this is our first September as part of Gloucester Vineyard Church. So you might not have heard some of this stuff before. It might be your first Sunday in the room full stop. If it is, hi. Welcome. It's great to have you. If you're fairly new to this community, if you're new to faith, hopefully this will be a helpful moment when we can talk about who we are and how we think and why we do the things the way we do things around here. Hopefully it's helpful as a reminder for those of us who've been around for a while as well of the stuff that is important to us and the stuff that God has said to us over the years as he's formed us. Now, quick caveat before we go any further. Today is absolutely not a big pat on the back, aren't we wonderful, aren't we the perfect church moment. No, that's absolutely not what we're doing today. We like to think of ourselves as one big chunky vegetable in the beautiful church stew that is the church of Jesus Christ. We do what we do to represent Jesus in the world as best we can alongside all of the other churches in our county. And we do what we do as faithfully as we can. This is a moment for us who are currently leading the church, us guys, to talk about this church, to talk about what God has called us to do and who he has called us to be. So last week, as I say, Emily talked about the church and today the plan is to talk about this church. And so before we go any further, I thought it would be fun to hear from some of you guys. And so before we dive in, I just want you to turn to the people around you and answer me a really quick question. If you could describe your home in four words, four things that you want your home to be, what four things would they be? Now, maybe you're not living in your ideal home situation right now. Maybe you're sofa surfing or sleeping rough. If that's the case, maybe you could think about your ideal home. Like if you could live anywhere, what would that look like? So just take a couple of minutes with the people around you, have a quick discussion, and then I'm going to come around and I'm going to pass the microphone to you and I want to hear back from you. So four things. If you could describe your home in four words, what would those four things be? Go. Okay, let's hear from some of you guys then. Four words. You don't have to tell me all four. Some words. Let's start with my fan club over here. Is it okay if I call you my fan club? No? Okay, go on then. Four words to describe your home. What would you say? Colourful. Okay, good. Anything else? Food. Excellent. Cheap. Can I just clarify? Is that... Cheap? Well raised. The ideal home. Is your home made of food or is there food in your home? There's food in the home, so it's not like a Hansel and Gretel situation. Okay, good to know. Anybody else? What have we got? Put your hands up if you've got something to share. Yes. Dani said cosy. Ooh, cosy. Very good. Very good. Anything else? What have we got? Hospitable. Hospitable, very good. Yeah, yep, okay. Peaceful. Ah, peaceful. Very good, yep. So, I would really like to live in a house that isn't a supported living because it's really, really noisy and because I'm autistic it's driving me absolutely round the bend. So, I prefer something like my own kind of little space with like a lot quieter and a lot sort of more simple and cheaper. So, you're also on cheap, you're also on peaceful. Very good. Okay, what else have we got? Well, actually both James and myself were talking about community. A home that is for community and a home with really good food and a home with engaging conversations. Fantastic, very good. Okay. Somewhere that's safe. Safe, yes. These are all good. Anything on this side of the room? What have we got? Any of you guys? Yes. Warm. Warm is good. Anything else? Yes. I said sanctuary. Ooh, good word, good word. So, kind of got some words, warm, peaceful, sanctuary, cheap, food. It's all good, it's all good. So, today that's basically what we're going to be doing today. We're going to be talking about four things that we as a leaders team feel kind of describe our community, our home, both the community that we are as a church and the community that we aspire to be. So, I'm going to really quickly introduce just four characteristics that we feel just kind of express how we feel about our church. If we were going to say those four things about what we want this church to be. And then one of these lovely people is going to take some time to unpack that a little bit for us. They're going to be talking about how this part of our DNA works itself out in our community at the moment. They're going to be talking about some biblical and prophetic backing for why it's important to us. And they're going to talk about the ways that we can kind of imagine expressing that more in the future. And so, the four kind of Gloucestershire Vineyard Church characteristics we're going to be talking about today is that as a community we are gathered, we are, where am I? There we are, growing, grounded and going. So, that's gathered, growing, grounded and going. And we believe that God has called us as a community to be all of those four things and they all conveniently begin with G for Gloucestershire. So, isn't that great? It's worth saying that we don't think that we're different or special as a church to be called to these four things. Actually, we believe that these are four things that all churches are called to be. But there are a couple of ways that we express ourselves in these areas which are kind of more particular to this community and these guys are going to be unpacking that. And so, I've kind of laid a bit of a challenge down for these guys. I've said, these are the four areas. What I'd like you to do is come and bring a whole load of Bible, tell us about why we do what we do, envision us, and you've got to do it in like three minutes. So, these guys have got quite a challenge. So, we're going to be encouraging, aren't we? We're going to be kind of vocally encouraging too, aren't we? Yes, we are. So, if one of these guys says something you agree with, why don't you use your words to tell them, be like, yes, come on, I love it. And we'll give them a very small round of applause at the end. How does that sound? Okay, so Emily's going to go first. Emily's going to talk to us about being gathered. Everybody give her a very small round of applause. Very good. I think we even have a slide that might have the four things on it. Oh, there you go, and the next one. There we go. Look at that. Oh, that's nice. So, gathered. This is one of our core characteristics as a church. And this basically means that we are a community of people. Not simply a load of individuals who happen to be in the same place at the same time on a Sunday afternoon. Right at the beginning of the Bible, in the first book called Genesis, we read about God's creation and the first not good thing was that man was alone. Humans are created for community in all different shapes, forms, and sizes and inclusive of introverts and extroverts. But we are designed to work together, to require each other, to fill the earth and subdue it, as Genesis would say, together. And the church is the Jesus-shaped expression of this. Often called the body of Christ. In a book called 1 Corinthians 12 in the New Testament of the Bible, Paul, the guy who writes that book, writes this. The human body has many parts, but the many parts make up one whole body. And so it is with the body of Christ. If one part suffers, all the parts suffer with it. And if one part is honored, all the parts are glad. All of you together are Christ's body and each of you is a part of it. So humanity is designed for community and the church is designed to be a gathered community. We're designed to be functioning effectively as everyone together, rejoicing and suffering together. All of us thriving in who and how God has made us because we are attached to and enabled to by others who are doing the same. When we were praying for\n\nProve to the world that you are my disciples. And this is why we really value being together, being hospitable and welcoming to any and all who want to know more about following Jesus. Like, look around us, in what other environment do we get the PhD student and the school dropout praying together? In what other environment do we get the millionaire and the day-to-day survivalist having a piece of toast together? Where else does the new baby get 10 new grandparents and 50 aunties, uncles and cousins except here? If we want to know Jesus, if we want the world to know Jesus, we need to love one another as he loved us. And so we need to be together, we need to eat together and we need to know each other. And here at Gloucester Vineyard Church, we try and emulate that in a variety of ways. For example, we have home groups. These are wonderful places to be known, to be challenged, to do life with people, maybe even people who don't look or live like us. Every year we have our church weekend away. There's a whole weekend with a prime purpose of just being together, being community, sharing meals, laughs, woes together. Of course, we have these, our Sunday gatherings like this every week, coming together as one body. And we value and we make space for and accommodate genuine community over things like tea and toast, with games. We have discussion moments, we have tea and coffee as people come in. And so as we keep being church, I just want to have this on our radar and our intent, being a gathered people. Let us love one another like in a true Jesus-shaped love kind of way. Let's eat together, share together, talk together. Let's be vulnerable and safe together. Let's be honest and kind. Let's safeguard each other. Let's advocate for each other. Let's encourage each other, lovingly correct each other, because this is how Jesus loves us, right? Let our loving gathered community point to Jesus. I'm just going to finish this three minutes is what I'm going to tell you. I've just been talking for with a quote from the book of Hebrews where it says, let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope we affirm, for God can be trusted to keep his promise. Let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love and good works. And let us not neglect our meeting together as some people do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of his return is drawing near. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Emily. I do love my wife, but I said to her, it's got to be three minutes. And she's like, I will speak for as long as I want to. Thank you very much. Ryan, over to you. I'll speak for two minutes. Thanks, Emily. I want to speak about growing in shrinking time. No, the beautiful value, the second one is just around growth and growing at GVC. When we think of growth, there's so many ideas that come to mind. Social media kind of spews personal growth at us and emotional growth. Our podcasts are full of growth. But whilst that's great and whilst God wants us to grow personally, emotionally and spiritually, it's not just about our personal dreams, our desires. God has dreams for us that are bigger than ourselves. He has an abundant vision for the world and he sees us as part of that vision. And he loves and knows us and therefore wants us to know his will in flourishing. So the question is, what does Jesus in the Bible say about growth? And I know that this can even be complicated, right? Because, I mean, the Christian to-do list, praying and gathering together and meeting together and giving, just can be overwhelming. So how do we understand this as simple as possible? And the simplest version I've come up with is, am I connected with Jesus? John 15, 5 says, I'm the vine and you're the branches and if you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit and apart from me you can do nothing. The great part about this is that the remaining in him part is unique for all of us. We all find God's unique, sustainable will and rhythm for our lives. And this connection gets fostered in our hearts and in our minds from the inside out. I recall a word that I had for myself and I felt for the church a couple of years back and it was a picture of potatoes. And so the gardeners amongst us will know that potatoes grow underground and all you see are kind of the leaves and the shoots above ground and you don't know what's happening and you kind of just have to trust that growth is happening under there in the hidden and secret place. Until the harvest and then you see these wonderful potatoes. And I'm Irish and I love a french fry like anybody else. And I love a potato. And I just felt God say that it was going to be in the hidden places of our lives that God's going to grow GVC. The second aspect of our growth as Emily has alluded to is just being part of this body and how we join together to grow. God made it this way so that we actually need to rely on each other to live this abundant life that he's called us to. In Proverbs 27, 17 it says, as iron sharpens iron so one person sharpens another. So being part of this body at GVC is not just about coming to church or being on the hospitality team or serving or attending meetings but being joined together in that friendship, you know, that close bond that you form with the person next to you by helping, by giving to each other in various ways, calling each other into our own calling in God and asking how the Bible applies to our lives in this day and age, all towards Jesus, that we live deeply in his love. Now, we are not about, you know, creating a commune or cult, right? But this is really just an invitation to discover what Jesus is saying to all of us, to this exciting life that we're exploring together with God. So at GVC this looks like taking our next steps towards him in home groups and, you know, sharing our problems and our challenges, sharing our successes and our wins in a real way and just being honest with each other about where we are in our walks with God. Serving our city and our neighbors side by side and, you know, sometimes taking risks with and for each other. This place is a place of community and of friendship first as we grow together and towards Jesus. And that's really what growing here at GVC looks like. And I'm sure that was not two minutes. Thank you, Ryan. Give him a quick round of applause. Thanks, buddy. Okay, thirdly, let's talk about being grounded. What the heck does that mean? Diane, over to you. Grounded, it's awesome. The church is grounded. We are grounded on the foundation of our faith in who Jesus is as the King and Savior of the world, in the gift of God's word to us in the Bible, and in God's presence to us in the Spirit who lives in us and who works amongst us and who is at work in His world. So at GVC, we want to be grounded. We want to be grounded in God's word, in God's activity, and in being shaped by really good theology, which we know brings life. Now, who can get excited about some good theology? All right, all right. I heard a few. I heard a few there. Not sure? Who can get excited that we are all new creations, new people in Christ? There we go. That's some great theology. Who can get excited that we are made in the very image of God? That's some Genesis 1 action, right, that God has made us in His image and has given us the task of representing Him in the world. So good theology, let's hear it. So we are people of God's kingdom where we strive to live under the management of Jesus and bring that reality of God's kingdom more and more into this present time. And we want to be a community then where we preach and live out this amazing good news. To do that, we seek to let the Bible speak into our lives as we gather on a Sunday, as we meet in home groups, as we connect for coffee, prayer time, wherever we might connect. Now, sometimes wrestling with the Bible means that we also are a community where we strive to listen, we discuss, and sometimes even disagree well. That means that when we disagree, we want to do that in grace and in love. So we are not perfect. Yeah, I'll hear it for that. We're not perfect, and we're not the only church living out this life-giving reality of the kingdom. As Daniel said, all churches are bringing the same core commitments, and then every church brings some special sauce, right? A little ingredient to the stew. As a vineyard church, we are\n\npeople who want the Bible to be our plumb line. We want to seek God's kingdom in all its ways here, even while we recognize it's not going to be complete. We particularly value worship as a priority in the church. So at GVC, we are a worshiping community. We want to encounter God in our worship. And we want to lean into and look for the activity of the Holy Spirit because we believe that the Spirit is alive and well and at work here and now. And so we say, come and do your work, Holy Spirit, right? We want to be at Gloucester Vineyard Church, a church where everybody gets to play. That's a funny vineyard phrase. Everybody gets to play, right? That means that we believe that every believer is qualified for work in the kingdom. All are empowered by the Spirit for God's good work in the world and in the church, and that is regardless of your education, your background, your family circumstance, your age, your gender. At GVC, we particularly value the children among us as part of the church now. And we particularly want to empower women to fulfill their gifts in the church, to lead and to flourish as God has called and gifted them. In Luke's biography of Jesus, in chapter 4, Jesus says, the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released, that the blind will see, and that the oppressed will be set free, and that the time of the Lord's favor has come. Now that is some good news that we want to be grounded in and we want to share with others. Come on. You guys are very self-controlled. I was like, ooh, yeah, come on. That was very good. All right, Aaron, finish us off. Well done. Okay, here we go. Here we go. So my part of today's talk is about going, and I'm spinning off from two key Bible passages. The first is from Philippians chapter 2. Paul was writing to some Greek Christians when he said, have the same attitude in yourselves which was in Christ Jesus. Look to him as your example of selfless humility. He existed in the form and unchanging essence of God. Jesus was one with him, possessing the fullness of all the divine attributes. Yet he didn't regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, as if he didn't already possess it or he was afraid of losing it. He took the form of a servant and became completely human. I'm guessing Jesus was pretty darn comfortable in heaven. I could have thought, well, you know, life as God is good. I like it here, and Earth can be a pretty hard place. I'll just send some prophets and some visions and stuff, and hopefully they'll eventually get the idea and start doing the right things and loving me. Well, he could have, and he did that for a time. Yet John chapter 3 reminds us that because of his love, because of his love, Jesus left that place of comfort to experience alongside us a sometimes uncomfortable place that is life on this planet. Going, though, is a part of God's own plan, and he's going places. The second key Bible passage that I want to point to that emphasizes going is in Matthew chapter 28. Jesus is talking with his disciples, and he said, all power of absolute rule in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go and make disciples of all nations. Help people to learn of me, believe in me, and obey my words. Baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Teach them to observe everything that I have commanded you. I'm remaining with you as you do this, regardless of circumstance and on every occasion, even to the end of the age. If there were ever some famous last words that challenge us to be going, this is it. Jesus told his disciples, go and make disciples everywhere. The call to follow Jesus has not been, go and make some comfortable gatherings and hang out. It's always been about going and going beyond ourselves. So GVC is and wants to be, as we keep going forward, looking out and going out. God has given us hope, and it's too good to keep to ourselves. We live with open hands, willing to give of our time and our resources and our energy. We don't just talk about bringing hope and joy to Gloucestershire. We have to be willing to go and do it. And as we go, we invite people to join God's family. Going involves being hopeful in a hopeless world. When we serve, when we care, when we show up in kindness, we demonstrate the heart of Jesus. And the beautiful truth in God's kingdom, like Diane mentioned just a moment ago, everybody gets to play. Every single one of us has been invited to go, carrying his hope and his joy wherever we go. We also believe that going requires creativity. A couple hundred years ago, there were almshouses. What the heck was an almshouse? Well, that was established to provide for the poor and the elderly or others who couldn't support themselves. Nowadays, we do things differently. We have an English conversation group in Chai and Chat. We provide supplies for parents of infants in Grow Baby. We host adults caring for children in Vibes. And then there are clubs and groups that various folks are involved in through the week. So God has even given somebody in our church, a couple of folks in our church, a vision of going out with an ice cream truck and handing out free ice cream as a way of bringing joy into the city streets. Who knows what God may lead us to do next as we go? Who knows? But keep listening. So as we partner with Jesus, he leads us to multiply his church, creating new communities where people can encounter him. So going isn't optional. It's at the very heart of what it means to follow Jesus. So the questions are, where is God calling you? Where is God calling me to go? And the good news with that is that wherever we go, we know that Jesus goes with us and will help us every step of the way. You know you're in the right church when you get the biggest whoop of enthusiasm for ice cream truck, right? Like, yeah, talking about like kingdom of God and people being set free and people like, ice cream truck? Where's the ice cream truck? Anyway, okay, we've spoken for ages. Why don't you guys get back into those little groups really, really quickly and just discuss like which one of those four kind of stood out to you the most? Which one resonated for you the most? Maybe you get excited about being a kind of gathered community about hospitality, about being a family and creating an environment of belonging. Maybe it's about growing. Maybe discipleship is your thing. You want to see people healed and restored and released from stuff that's holding them back. Or maybe you're one of the Bible nerds amongst us who loves a bit of kingdom theology and wants to see the Holy Spirit ministering to people. Or maybe you want to go. Maybe you are excited about the idea of creating new communities and rolling up our sleeves and going and serving our neighbors. So just take literally two minutes. Chat to the people around you. We'll say goodbye to these guys. Give them a round of applause. Thank you. Two minutes and then we'll wrap it all up. Okie dokie. So before the kiddos come back in again and join us, just wanted to bring this thing into land. So a couple of weeks ago, my friend Steve grabbed me after church and said he'd been reading the last book of the Bible called The Revelation. Anybody ever read any of that? Interesting read, isn't it? Very interesting read. Not a book I've read an awful lot if I'm honest. But the book starts, if you've read it before, with Jesus basically sending a message to seven of the first churches. Basically giving them a report card. That's a terrifying prospect for someone like me. Can you imagine like Jesus giving us a report card on our church? It's just terrifying. And in some of these letters, Jesus is commending these churches for what they're doing and he's bringing some correction and challenge in other cases. And as I read these letters to some of the churches, it kind of percolated back into the top of my mind this week as I was preparing for today. And there's one report card in particular that got my attention. It's probably the best known of the seven. It's the last one. And it kind of sticks in the mind because it's got quite a funny mental picture associated with it. Let me read it to you. It's written to a church in a place called Laodicea. And Jesus says this, I know all of the things you do, that you are neither hot nor cold. I wish that you were one or the other. But since you are like lukewarm water, neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth. You say I'm rich and I have everything I want. I don't need a thing. And you don't realize that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked. That's nice, isn't it? Isn't that nice? Can you imagine Jesus handing you that on your report card? Like C for effort. Not a comforting thing to be told by Jesus. I'm sure they're all patting themselves on the back when they read that. But these verses have come back to me this week as I've been preparing this. Not because I think that God is necessarily saying that to us as a church, but because as Emily said last week, I think there is a real risk for our church or any church really. Last week, Emily talked about how easy it is for us to let the church fade into the background, for us to take the church for granted,\n\nto forget that the church is meant to be a revolutionary force. Did anyone else have a really convicting moment last week listening to Emily when she started talking about what the church is supposed to be like? And you're sitting there thinking, that doesn't describe my church. Anyone else have that moment? Oh, was it just me? Oh gosh, you guys are amazing. That was quite a convicting moment for me as one of the leaders of this church. Like, wow, that's amazing. That doesn't describe our church. It's okay. Now I've said that out loud, would anyone like to put their hand up and say, yeah, maybe a little bit in some ways? We do okay, we do okay. As I was preparing this, I really thought you'd react differently to that, I'm sorry. As I was preparing this week, I just really felt like God say, I want you to turn up the heat at Gloucester Vineyard Church. I want you to turn up the temperature on these four things. I felt like God say, this is the church that I've called you to be. I have not called you to be a church in the background. I have not called you to be a lukewarm church. I have not called you to be a church which plays its tune at half volume, who's a little bit hospitable when we feel like it, who quite likes kingdom theology or who kind of occasionally allows women to preach, or who sometimes goes and does some nice things in the community, or who kind of theoretically believe that miracles happen, but we never actually seek them. Who's too afraid of offending people to challenge injustice in the world. I felt like Jesus say, look out, watch out. I want you to guard against being lukewarm. Guard against being a community where we express these characteristics that we've been talking about as background noise. The church is not supposed to dwell in the background. We are supposed to be advancing into enemy territory with a confident declaration that Jesus is the king. Thank you. I'm gonna say that again. You're all supposed to say that. Where am I? Oh dear. It's been a long week. The church is not supposed to dwell in the background. We are supposed to be advancing into enemy territory with a confident declaration that Jesus is the king. That's much more like it. As I said earlier on, there is nothing special or new or innovative about the things that we've shared today. These are things that all churches are called to be and much, much more. But the reality is that we can express these things quietly and we will be a really nice community, or we can express these things at full volume and be a revolutionary force that Emily was talking about last week. We can be that revolutionary force that Jesus calls us to be. The question for us today is how loudly are we being these four things? How passionately are we these things? How fervently are we embodying these things? As a community, we are not called to be lukewarm. We are called to be on fire. We are an expression of the church of Jesus Christ. We are called to be invested in this city, to show up everywhere we go, to announce and demonstrate the good news of the arrival of the kingdom of God. We are called to be carriers of the kingdom. As Diane shared earlier on, we are called to proclaim freedom for the captives, recovery of sight for the blind, and to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. Gloucester Vineyard Church, we are not called to be a lukewarm church. Amen? We are called to be a church on fire for Jesus. Okay, this is who we are. Kiddos, welcome back. Sorry, you kind of came in and I was in the middle of a flow of thought there, but I appreciate you. You snuck in like little sneaky weasels. That was amazing. Welcome back. Why don't we celebrate communion together as we finish?"

    "transcript": "Carrie is going to share with us today, and I'm just kind of going to prompt her with some questions. But today we're going to be talking about safeguarding. Yes! So I'm sure that safeguarding is something that all of us have heard of, and different ones of us have encountered safeguarding in different ways in the real world. Maybe it's in a work context or in a church context, or hearing safeguarding represented on the news somehow. Today we're going to be talking about safeguarding within church life. But this is not safeguarding training, okay? You're not going to leave from today with a certificate. Instead, Carrie and I are going to be talking about why safeguarding is central to the gospel. Our intention today is to inspire each of us to see how safeguarding is not an additional extra to the gospel. It's not a boring and annoying impediment to the gospel, but actually that it sits right at the very heart of the gospel. And when we say, yes, so somebody just said yes. So if anything that's said today you agree with, as ever with Gloucester Vineyard Church, we would love to hear that affirmation. So if you agree, then like yes, come on, amen. Hallelujah. All of those things are good today, so let's have some of those. So today, so I've just used the word gospel a lot. Just to define that term, when we talk about the gospel, we mean the good news that Jesus Christ came to earth 2,000 years ago, that he became like us in every way, that he lived a fully human life like ours, that he announced and demonstrated the kingdom of God was arriving, that he was crucified, that he died, that he rose from the dead, he ascended to heaven and established the church, and so much more. That is the gospel, that's the good news. And we have the contention that our responsibilities to be a safeguarding church sit right at the heart of the gospel. And so that's what we're going to be unpacking today. But to start with, Carrie, why don't you introduce yourself? Oh, you haven't got a microphone, that's awful. I can shout. Yeah, very good. Hello, everybody. Thank you so much for inviting me to speak today. It's a good start. So I've been asked to tell you a little bit about myself and my journey as a Christian. So I was fortunate to be born into a Christian family and as a little girl went to a very traditional Anglican church that was kind of struggling with that move between tradition and modernity. And it wasn't always obvious to me as a little girl where God's vision for the world was in that space. It felt like people were going through the motions and it felt like it had little impact beyond the door of that church. However, I was lucky. My parents were always an amazing example to me of what God's love for the world looks like. And so I've really grown up admiring their approach to public service, the way that they cared for their family, their hospitality, their generosity, and just generally how they modeled servant-heartedness to me. So I have always called myself a Christian, but I think it probably wasn't until I was in my early 20s that I started to have a think about what that actually means for me and for who I am in God. I spent some time living in Leeds and was part of a really big church up in Leeds and felt quite out of place in that space. But whilst I was there, God really called me to have a heart for women who were involved in street sex work. And the way that God works is that he makes that possible. And so a few weeks after I'd been kind of praying around that, an organization called the Joanna Project came and spoke at my church. So the Joanna Project are an amazing charity who provide outreach and support to women who have been or are involved in street sex work. These women are some of the most vulnerable women we have in our communities. They're often placed outside the bounds of our communities. They're not seen as members of our community. They're treated appallingly by men. And they're also treated appallingly by the systems that should be there to protect them. However, the Joanna Project showed me God's vision for these women. And that vision was to provide hope, to provide love, and to provide dignity so that they could live a life that was full in all its abundance. So this is where God really showed me his vision for his love in the world and my role seeking justice within that. So fast forward a few more years, I moved to Gloucestershire and I still volunteer with a street sex work outreach organization. But God has also put me in a place of employment where I have the opportunity to shape the system that people facing disadvantage often don't get the best responses from. So this involves me spending a lot of time trying to persuade people that hold quite a lot of power that we need to do things better and we need to do things differently. It also involves funding services that provide physical safe spaces for people to live. So I feel really privileged that God has put me where he's put me in a space where he is using my skills and my passion for justice. I mean, right? Come on. So how cool is it to have Carrie speaking to us today? We've also invited Carrie to come and speak to us because you are Gloucester Vineyard Church's safeguarding lead. So could you really quickly share to us what you do as safeguarding lead and what exactly does that mean? Yeah, sure. So essentially I am helping Gloucester Vineyard Church ensure it's a safe space for people who we may see as being vulnerable. So this includes all of our kids, our young people and adults within our community who may have care and support needs. When we talk about care and support needs, what we're talking about that's kind of a legal definition. But essentially what it means is people who need support around practical things, financial things, emotional things, who just need that extra help to manage their lives to be independent. So this includes older people, it includes people who have disabilities or long-term illnesses, people with mental health difficulties and people who care for those individuals. So practically what that looks like in the church is involving that, making sure that we have an up-to-date safeguarding policy. So having a policy that is something that we follow in our practice that informs the way that we do things. It also involves supporting those who work and volunteer in the church with support and training to understand what those responsibilities look like so that we are all skilled to recognize abuse and neglect and safeguard everyone that comes to be part of this church. It also means listening to any concerns that come up, so seeking people who may need some advice and providing that advice and responding to safeguarding concerns in kind of timely ways and appropriate ways. But it also means sitting here and talking to you and reassuring you that it's okay to raise a concern if you're worried about somebody, it's okay to come forward with that because safeguarding is really a responsibility that we all have. It's not something that Emily and Daniel have as leaders here, it's something that we're all responsible for. More than that though, as Christians, it's our calling to follow Jesus who we can kind of see as the ultimate safeguarding champion and to make it our business to care about children and adults who are at risk of harm in this church. More broadly though, I think my role is also to be part of supporting GVC to be a place where we're all safe in all of our vulnerabilities and brokenness, where we are all invested in maintaining safety and where we can really cultivate a culture of care, deep care for each other and our local community. Brilliant. A quick show of hands, how many people encounter safeguarding on a fairly regular basis in their work? Yeah, so fair few of us have kind of heard about this. Safeguarding seems to be everywhere at the moment. I'm sure as we've just seen, we all kind of encounter safeguarding in some way, shape or form. Seems like a really big thing to me, but it also seems like quite a recent thing as well. Does anyone resonate with that? Like I can remember a time before safeguarding. Can you tell us a little bit more about where this idea, where this language has come from and why it seems to be everywhere? Yeah, sure. So in terms of safeguarding as a kind of legal thing and in terms of it being something that we have to do, so a practice, it is quite rightly an ever evolving thing. But if we look at it in kind of the last, kind of if we're thinking about history of safeguarding, then safeguarding children and the formal frameworks that we have for child protection have only really been around for the last 80 years. Sadly, as is the case with lots of legislation and policy change, it often comes from reviews of tragic circumstances. So circumstances where we get things wrong. So often the deaths of children have informed changes in policy and practice and legislation. So in more recent\n\nIn history, you may have heard the names Victoria Climby, Holly Wells, Jessica Chapman. Their tragic deaths have shaped the way that we protect children today. If we think about adults, then we've got a bit of legislation called the Care Act 2014. This established kind of what we know safeguarding to be today. It's what we call a statutory duty. What that means is that it's something that councils, local authorities must do, and they must do it in a certain way. So it sets out the way that we have to do that duty. It also provides us with definitions of different types of abuse and neglect that people who are particularly vulnerable may experience. But it also includes some types of abuse that we might not think of as being so obvious in terms of safeguarding. So things like modern slavery are included. Things like institutional abuse are also included. So for both children and adults, most of the legislation we've got has been put in place in the last 20 years or so, and is informed by continued tragedies, continued situations where things haven't gone the way that they should have gone. So we've still got a really long way to go, even though we've got this legislation. We've still got a long way to go to ensure that victims of abuse are heard and first and foremost believed. So our initial response needs to be listening, not making assumptions, not passing judgment, but taking concerns seriously when they're raised is really important. So it's been kind of interesting for me personally, just as I've been leading and managing in different contexts, to kind of see the rise of safeguarding over the last 10 to 15 years and see it come into more and more spaces. And one of the things that I've observed, I've kind of seen a spectrum of ways that organizations tend to respond to safeguarding. Some will kind of go to one end of the spectrum and kind of risk assess themselves into a corner and feel like, oh, we can't do anything because everything is a risk. And so we kind of don't do what we should be doing. And then on the other end of the spectrum, you see organizations who are almost kind of scornful of safeguarding and kind of almost treat it like political correctness gone mad or like a nuisance box ticking exercise that we have to go through. Something that's just kind of got to be out of the way, get out of the way, just do the safeguarding thing and then we can crack on. Do you see that? Do you have any thoughts about that? So I think I didn't feel like I can come here today and say that we get it right because I think we need to start by recognizing that this is unfortunately something that the wider church has historically got very, very wrong on individual and organizational levels. So there have been systemic safeguarding failures across the global church. And I find that personally really difficult to reconcile that we are all reading the same gospel and yet we are behaving in ways that are really problematic and harmful. So we have this amazing commission from God and a gospel vision for our role in the world as peacemakers, as those who care for the abused and the oppressed. And then on the other hand, we have historically seen the church as sites of horrendous abuse. We have seen faith be weaponized. We have seen hierarchies of power that have protected abusers. We have seen victims not be heard. We've seen victims not be believed. And we've seen things covered up. And we've got to do better. So I continue to pray that God really breaks through in that space. I've already told you that I grew up as an Anglican, so I'm not outing myself as an Anglican. But I'm really encouraged that the new Archbishop of Canterbury, who's also a woman, has a really strong record on safeguarding. I think it's absolutely intentional that that is a skill set within the person that they have appointed to such an influential post. I pray that her example will be a real model to the church in all its forms across the world. That we see through her that we're called to be a people that speak up. That we are called to be a people whose hearts are broken for those facing disadvantage and abuse. And that we can, through that, become a people who are deeply invested in changing the hearts, minds, and behaviors of those who abuse. Bringing it back to the practicalities of doing safeguarding well, I think we can overcomplicate it. We can get bogged down in policy, process, legislation. Although those things are all really important, they're there to support us to be safe. There's kind of a middle ground, I think, that's important where we locate safeguarding as part of our duty of care. And that's part of our duty of care to all in our community. It's our kingdom work. It's foundational to the way that we welcome people. Whether that's at Chai and Chat or on a Sunday afternoon here. It's part of the way we walk alongside people in community and meet people's needs. So thinking about how we do our home groups, how we have conversations over tea and toast, how we welcome families and provide them with clothing at Grow Baby. So I think if we can see this as foundational in our culture of modeling Jesus' example, our attempts to, as Christians, become more like him, then we stand the best chance of it not being just what we do, but who we are. Yeah, agreed. Yeah, yeah. So we've mentioned that Carrie is our safeguarding lead. I just wanted to take a quick moment to voice, some of you may know this, that being a safeguarding lead for a church is often a tricky job. And it takes a lot of hard work behind the scenes. And it's often not particularly pleasant. But as Carrie has shared, we do have a statutory duty to do it, but we also have a wonderful gospel duty to do it as well. So can we embarrass Carrie by saying thank you to her by giving a quick round of applause? And before we move on, I also wanted to ask you guys to commit to pray for Carrie in what she does, because she is doing something which is an enormous act of service for our church. And we really want to back her with prayer, don't we? Because we're super grateful for what she does. There's a lot that happens behind the scenes that most of us just simply won't know about. So please take a moment to say thank you to her personally as well. Gotcha. So Carrie, why don't you tell us, from your perspective, as a church and as followers of Jesus, what is the position that you think we should take? Why do you think that safeguarding is kind of core and central to the gospel? Sure. So safeguarding for me is about righteousness and justice. It's about how we reflect God and how that shapes our identity as being made in God's image. It's about a choice we have between either benefiting from injustices and our own levels of privilege, or being a people who want to follow Jesus by healing the brokenness of our world. I think it's what we're called to do as followers of Jesus. And for me, rather than it being something that's an additional extra to the gospel message, or an annoying impediment to the work of the gospel, I feel safeguarding is core to the gospel itself. It's a fundamental element of God's work in the world through history from the beginning of time. Our lovely Sarah calls it a gospel imperative, and I really like that word imperative. It is something we must do. These ideas we find woven the whole way through the Bible. They are seen in the interactions between God and the lives of people we meet in the Old Testament. Then at the core of the New Testament, we're presented with radical justice, which we see embodied in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. So as we read through the first part of our Bibles, the bit we call the Old Testament, we find ourselves in a story that starts with brokenness, starts with this beautifully created world going absolutely wrong. So where our relationship with God and with each other and the world was broken by selfishness and self-centeredness, and where humanity is forced to go on through human history trying to work ourselves out of that space, working out how to relate to God within that, the way we relate to each other and the world in a way that is good, just, and meaningful. It's an ongoing thing for all of us to work out. So interestingly, humanity throughout all of that never loses its God-given commission to govern the world on his behalf and by his wisdom. So what we see is hundreds and hundreds of years, generation after generation of humanity walking through life trying to work that out. Trying to see how are we going to live a good life? How are we going to function in this world that's broken? How are we going to relate to God?\n\nto each other and the world. Thankfully, as with everything, we're not doing this on our own. God is not silent on this subject. So throughout the Bible, God reveals himself. He reveals himself to the people of the Old Testament in the form of instructions. We're given laws and principles on how we form communities. And we also see this in how he works directly through spokespeople that we call prophets. So he chose so many different ways of revealing himself and communicating his heart to the people of the Old Testament over the years. So what amazes me is that God doesn't just give cold instructions and commands to his people. In that, we see he reveals something of his nature and character. He reveals a deep longing and motivations. And we get to know more of God in his vision for righteousness and justice on earth. So if you use those words a couple of times, and they can be used to mean all sorts of things. So we'll start with the word righteousness. Are you going to use some ancient Hebrew now? Oh, I'm not going to say the word. Go on, you've got to do it. Give it a go. So I have heard the Hebrew word for righteousness, tzedeq. Yes. Thanks, Sarah. So we find that word in the Bible, and we can see it being discussed by people who know a lot more than I do as being about what is right and just in line with God's moral order. It's about our ethical standard for us and our relationships. Now on to justice. So we associate the word justice most often with the concept of someone facing the consequences of their actions. But in the Bible, the Hebrew word for justice is used to build an understanding of the just nature of God. And most of what we see in the Bible is all about restorative justice. It's actively seeking out vulnerable people who are being taken advantage of and helping them. It's about charity. It's about advocating for the vulnerable, challenging the structures within our society that maintain oppression and disadvantage. If we look at the book of Micah, this is spelled out really clearly. So Micah 6 verse 8 says, God has told you what is good. Do justice, love mercy, walk humbly with God. Simple, right? If we look at the instructions that God gave to ancient Israel about how they should organize themselves as a society, there is an incredible weight towards the poor, the marginalized, the oppressed, and the victim. Of all the instructions that we have written in our Bibles, those big long lists of commands that we find in books like Deuteronomy and Leviticus, about 35 to 40% of them are all about restorative justice. They're about being compassionate, about being in active community that prioritizes care for the victim and the oppressed. And that's a huge proportion if we think about it in percentages. What's more, we don't think that the laws and commands and instructions we have in our Bibles is everything that we need or that ancient Israel would have needed to create and run their society. There were many more instructions that we just don't have access to anymore. So it's really striking, I think, that the commands that we do have are the ones that have been passed on. These are the ones that have been prioritized in communication and I think that's important for showing us so much of God's heart. There's a phrase that crops up in our Bibles again and again in the Old Testament when we are looking at God's heart for the poor and the marginalized, and that's around the widow, the orphan, and the foreigner. So Deuteronomy 10, we hear, he ensures that orphans and widows receive justice. He shows love to the foreigners living among you and gives them food and clothing. So you too must show love to foreigners, for you yourselves were once foreigners in the land of Egypt. And in Psalm 68, we hear, Father to the fatherless, defender of widows, this is God whose dwelling is holy. God places the lonely in families. He sets the prisoners free and gives them joy. So this little phrase, widow, orphan, and foreigner, I think can be used as a bit of a kind of catch-all for all of the most vulnerable members of our society. Those that don't have stable home situations, those who are at risk of harm or abuse because they don't have adequate protection or because they don't belong to any of the existing systems or can't access those systems. God makes it really clear to us that his community should care very deeply for those who would be considered vulnerable for whatever reason. And so for me, it's also been something that I have seen really clearly in Jesus' ministry in the early church. So when he began his public ministry and announced his mission to the world, he quoted a passage from one of the Old Testament prophets and he applied it to himself and to his ministry. This is in Luke 4. He says, The spirit of the Lord is on me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of the sights to the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour. We also see Jesus' brother James writing to the early church and he wrote this. It's in James 1. Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you. So I think whenever we hear that little phrase in our Bibles, when we hear of widows, orphans and foreigners, we should immediately think of this kind of broader group of vulnerable people. So I think it's really helpful for us to identify that safeguarding is all about vulnerable people. However they are vulnerable, however they're at risk of harm or abuse. And I think there are so many examples that we could have put in our chat today from the Bibles, so many verses that talk to the topic of safeguarding. And throughout the message is so clear. So I think communities that seek to represent God faithfully should structure themselves in such a way that the vulnerable are cared for, that they're protected, they're provided for and they're championed. I really believe that we are called to be a people who live a radical and selfless way of life rooted in our understanding of who we are in God and our knowledge of what Jesus did for us. God declared Jesus the righteous one in death, but he came back and offered us all the chance of righteousness. Even though we're selfish, we're broken, we're guilty of benefiting from injustices. And for me, this is what should compel us to seek justice. Because even though we all fall short, we all have a part to play in the restoration and healing of our communities and our world. So I think if we want to be a faithful Jesus community representing God's heart to the world, then care and attention towards the vulnerable is not an optional extra for us. It has to be at the core, a defining feature of who we are. So we're called to be a community who asks, who are the vulnerable people around us? And how can we best serve them and care for them? So for me, this is why it's not only a duty for us, but a part of our joy to take safeguarding so seriously in everything we do and see it as just a core thing that we do as Christians. Because in looking out for the vulnerable people inside and outside of our contexts is in absolute parallel with how God looks at the world and what he expects his communities to be doing. Amen. Come on. Isn't that good? Embo, what's happening with the kiddos? Are they going to stay over there? Okay, great. So if you've got kids over in kids' church, they're going to stay over there. We're just going to take a couple of minutes to wrap up, just going to get really, really practical. And then we're going to pray to finish and then go over for tea and toast. So to wrap up, one of the things we highlight fairly regularly is how people can report a concern if they have one. We have a nifty email address, which is safeguarding at glostervineyard.org, where you can email Carrie directly and you can highlight your concern to her. Could I just make a quick request that unless the concern is really, really urgent, we don't bring them to Carrie on a Sunday whilst she's here. It's really kind of compassionate and kind to Carrie to put that in.\n\nemail. I'm not responding to anything by the way. No one's done this. But as I was writing this I was thinking, oh if I was in Carrie's shoes that would be just the worst. So let's respect Carrie as our safeguarding lead. If you do have something you want to raise, please use that email address and let Carrie just come and worship because this is her church community. Carrie, is there anything you'd like to say about highlighting a concern? When should people be thinking they might need to do it? And yeah, when should they be thinking, oh I might need to talk to Carrie about that? Yeah, sure. So really, anytime you are worried that an adult who you think has care and support needs or a child, so just a reminder about care and support needs, that's about an adult who you think might be vulnerable for whatever reason, or a child is at risk of abuse or neglect. You do not need proof of that. You do not need evidence of that. Please don't go all Agatha Christie and start investigating anything. You just need to have a reasonable cause to suspect that somebody is at risk of harm. So even if you are unsure, it is always better to bring it to a safeguarding person. So it's always better to highlight it than not. I'd also say that even if something doesn't then transpire to fit that kind of legal definition of safeguarding that does have kind of certain parameters, actually there might be something that as a church we need to be doing on a pastoral level to support that person. What if I have a concern about someone who's a friend of mine or a fellow church member that I know and love? Surely raising a concern, that's going to make things awkward, right? Should I just keep it to myself? None of my business? See if it gets better on its own? No. So as we've said today, it's our business. In fact, we're commissioned by God to be right in our relationships and be active and intentional in our care and our pursuit of justice. So this may well look like raising a safeguarding concern. The Bible is quite clear that this stuff is hard and in a worldly sense this stuff is costly and it's hard and yes, you may feel awkward. But the Bible also reassures us that in a kingdom sense we are told, blessed are those who fight for justice and blessed are those who thirst for righteousness. And where would you send people if they want to know more? You've talked about righteousness and justice as about being kind of core themes in the Bible. If that's fairly new to us, if we want to dig deeper on that, where can people go to find out more information? There is a great video that the Bible Project have on justice. So I'd give that a Google and have a watch of that. But then my other encouragement is really just when you're opening your Bibles, when you are reading those passages, just keep in the back of your mind like where is God's vision for justice in this? Because it's everywhere. Okay, is there anything else that you'd like to share with us before we wrap up? Anything you'd like to share before we wrap up? I think just to kind of what we said earlier, safeguarding is really rooted in that kingdom vision for the world, for our community, for Gloucester Vineyard Church. And that in creating communities of hope and joy, we need to be rooted in safety. So it's imperative that we are creating a safe space here for all of us in all of our vulnerabilities, in all of our worldly brokenness, so that we can cultivate that culture of deep care for each other. Brilliant. Let's say thanks to Carrie again. Wasn't that amazing? Thank you. Thank you."

    "transcript": "We have this month been talking about church during the month of September. A couple of weeks ago we were looking at how and why the church, like the church in general, is absolutely wonderful. And last week we talked about some of the characteristics that define us as a community, so this church, and how we feel God has shaped and formed us to be this specific expression of his church here and now. So if you missed either of them, feel free to catch up on our podcast found on, or what's that phrase? Anyway, search Gloucester Vineyard Church. And today we thought we would bring this all together and we would both come and we would, well I was going to say share the mic, but have two separate mics. Because we have a bit of family business, as I mentioned earlier. We want to talk about some exciting next steps for us as a community as we move into what we sense God is calling us to over the coming years. And so we thought we would start by going on a bit of a storytelling journey, if you will indulge us. We just want to take some time to unpack a bit more of the Gloucester Vineyard story so far. What we've been hearing from God for us as a community. And that's in order to put into context and make sense of us talking about what's coming next. Does that sound alright? Good. Tough if not. Good, I was going to say that's what we're doing, so whether you like it or not. Let's rewind a few years then. Go on. So about 10 years ago when we were younger, more energetic, and had more hair, Em and I were in the process of getting ready to come and plant this church. Now if you've not heard the term church planting before, it's basically where you go somewhere where there isn't a church already and you start one from scratch. We felt really sure as a couple and as a family that that's what God was asking us to do. But we had all sorts of important questions about that process like where? Quite an important question to answer. Where and how and when and all that kind of stuff. How on earth are we going to do this? And so we went to go and visit some very wise friends of ours who've planted a church before. And we asked them these questions and they gave us a sage piece of advice which was when you plant is more important than where you plant. They said when you go is more important than where you go. Hands up if you, like me, think that that is bonkers advice. Yeah, it's bonkers advice, right? That's totally bonkers. But they responded when I said that's bonkers advice. They said, well, how many times have you had a conversation with people that goes along the lines of, oh, we were always going to go and do that amazing thing for God, but the timing was never quite right. Never quite was the right timing, so we never did it. You know, we feel like God asked us to do something, but, you know, it was the wrong time with the kids or something was going on with my career or I was washing my hair. And so we just never did that amazing thing that God asked us to do. So they said to us, when you go is more important than where you go. So get the when set in stone and the where will all follow. So we thought, what have we got to lose? Let's give this a try. So we went away and we prayed about it and we felt like God kind of laid on our hearts to plant a vineyard church somewhere in the early stages of 2018. And so we kind of aimed our life in that direction. And wouldn't you know that as we did that, as we kind of put that date in the diary, everything else in our life kind of followed the flow. So we found jobs, we figured out pretty quickly that it was going to be Gloucester. And here we are, February 2018, Gloucester Vineyard Church was born. Hooray! So first of all, do you want to see some photos of the first ever gathering? So we were at the climbing wall just on Parliament Street. There you go. Teeny tiny little room there. We just packed ourselves in there. There's a picture of Emily and I. We didn't have microphones back then, but I was pretending to hold a microphone. I don't know if we've got that other picture. Anyway, there's another one in there. We look younger. And then the following Sunday we did our very first Super Sunday. Look, there we are, out loving and serving the community with just a whole bunch of randomers who decided to come with us. Fair play to those guys who actually came out on that first ever Super Sunday. So that was about seven and a half years ago. And what a journey it's been. We've moved to various different venues over the years. We had the wonderful COVID years. Yes, shout out for Zoom church. Never again. We've always done Super Sundays. We've always tried to be servant-hearted. We've always played games and tried not to take ourselves too seriously. We've always preached the good news about the kingdom of God. We've always met in home groups and worshipped and eaten together. We've celebrated. We've mourned. And over that time God has changed and formed and moulded this church in ways that we, before we came here 10 years ago, could never have imagined. We could never have dreamed what God would ask us to do. You know, how he's consistently laid things in front of us of how he wants us to express his love and his kingdom here in Gloucestershire. You know, I think about starting a Christians Against Poverty debt centre within the first couple of years of the church's existence. It's just, we would never have thought that that was a good idea. I think about starting Grow Baby a couple of years ago. That was amazing. You know, a couple of years ago we ran like a county-wide clothing campaign to clothe 300 people are seeking asylum. Like, where did that come from? It was just laid in front of us as an opportunity. And it was really fun to say yes to. We love this church, Emma and I. We love leading this church. You guys are a consistent joy to us. And we're really excited to continue leading this church as we go on the journey. So, like Daniel says, sometimes the kind of God paths that have been laid in front of us have been one-off things like the clothing campaign that we did for the asylum seekers. Sometimes they've been quite unexpected and a bit of a left turn, like moving to St John's in the afternoon was a bit random for us. If you'd spoken to us four years ago, we would have been like, what? No. But here we are, and it's wonderful. We want to talk today, though, about a particular God path that we feel has been slowly but surely brewing over the years and is now bubbling to the surface. And we want to share that with you. About six years ago, we started to notice a few churchy things that kind of just rankled us a little bit. There seemed to be loads of church buildings just sitting empty around the city or indeed around the county. We were also hearing lots of stories of people from all over Gloucestershire traveling for like 45 minutes to an hour just to find a church to call home. And it was interesting because when lockdown hit five years ago, we noticed that there were quite a few people who fit this category joining us online from the surrounding villages because it was much easier online. And they were quickly becoming key people in our online home groups. And that's kind of when we started thinking, I wonder if GVC is just about like one community in Gloucester or whether there's something else kind of afoot in the county. It bothered us that Super Sunday was only serving one community when we represented several. It kind of bothered us that there were and are a number of neighborhoods that simply don't have a church presence in them at all, even in Gloucestershire, where there's a lot of churches. But there are still many places that do not. And about four years ago, as we were thinking these thoughts, a lovely family from South Africa joined us. Many of you may know Ryan and Lauren. And when they came, they came with a picture. Before they moved here, Lauren had been praying and she had received a picture from the Lord of World War II Dunkirk crossing, Operation Dynamo. Does anyone know about it? Oh, there you go. Basically, it was this mass evacuation in World War II of some Allied forces that were stranded on the beach in Dunkirk in France, stranded between the advancing German army and the sea. And in a wonderfully plucky British move, they basically did a call out to anyone and everyone who had a boat of any shape and size to get it on the water and join the rescue party. So boats of all shapes, sizes, purposes, fishing boats, pleasure boats, you name it, all crossed the channel to go and bring home as many troops as their vessels could. And that was the picture. And Lauren had a sense that it was a picture for the church. This idea of the church being on mission to reach as many people as possible in lots of small little boats of all shapes and sizes, each taking as many as they could hold. And this picture really resonated with us. It resonated deeply with how we were thinking of church at the time and feeling. And maybe God was inviting us to consider multiple smaller church communities rather than one big one. Around this time, we were also seeing quite a few of our fellow vineyard churches across the UK experimenting with what's called multi-site church. Simply, rather than kind of moving to a bigger building or building a bigger building or whatever as the church grows, instead becoming a multi-site church, which is a single church that gathers and serves in multiple locations across a county or a city. And so all of these things,\n\nsurprised when we got too big for a building, what if we just started to plan for it? What if we prayed for leaders to join our community? What if we invested in and trained them when they did? What if we kept our eyes and our ears and our hearts open to what was happening around the county, all in the faith that one day God might tell us that the moment for multiplication in Gloucester Vineyard Church was here? And so we did. We have been stepping into that over the past three or four years, holding and stewarding that vision, believing that God is speaking to us and preparing us for a moment of multiplication. And so last summer, Em and I were very lucky. We got to take a sabbatical from church leadership, which is basically just taking three months away to kind of recharge ahead of going again. And so this time last year, we had just stepped back in again and I was praying and seeking God for what was next for the church. You know, we'd just done seven years. Lord, what have you got next? And I wanted to know, was there anything that he had to say as we were stepping back into church life and back into leadership? And I felt like God called back to mind that moment that I just mentioned when we went to go and visit our friends, even before we started this church, where they said, when you go is more important than where you go. And I felt like God was saying, it's time to put a date in the diary again. It's time to do what I've laid on your heart to do. Now, I would love to say that I had a really good response to this, like Mary in our Bibles when the angel shows up and says she's going to have the baby Jesus. And she says, may it be unto me as you have said, oh Lord. I would love to say that I had that reaction, but actually my response was much more like Moses at the burning bush being like, seriously? Seriously? Our church? Have you seen our church? No offense. I thought they might laugh at that. There's like a slight delayed reaction. I love you guys. So I said, look, come on, Lord, have you seen our church? We're a dinky little church. Like being a multi-site church, creating new communities, that's what big churches do. Our church, it is not. It's a lovely church, but it's not a big church. You know, we don't have the people, we don't have the money, we don't have the energy. Basically, I said, Lord, we can't do what you're asking us to do because we don't have what we need. I said, Lord, give us all of the things that we need first and then we'll do it. How many of us in the room knows that that's not how things work in the economy of the kingdom of God? That's not how things work. How many of us know that faith is spelt R-I-S-K? So often, God is waiting to work, wanting to work, waiting to move, wanting to bless, but he wants us to make the first move before and step out in faith. In my mind, the way that church is multiplied is by just getting really big and see, and then just, because I've seen it happen before. I've been part of churches where that's been the case. You grow and you grow and you fill a space and then you do something to accommodate for the growth. You know, let's be really honest. We are not in that moment. But as we considered what God was saying, we did what one should always do when one senses that God has spoken just to make sure that you weren't eating too much mature cheddar last night. We took this idea, this thing that we thought God was saying about putting a date in the diary to some people that we love and people that we trust, and we asked them to help us to weigh it, to come back to us and say, you know, does this resonate with you? Does this seem like what God is doing? And one of those people went away and prayed and came back with a picture of cells dividing. I don't know if you've ever seen a time lapse of a cell dividing in two. What doesn't happen when a cell divides is it doesn't just get really, really big, get bigger and bigger and bigger and then kind of flop into two half-sized things. Instead, what it does is it creates everything that it needs within itself. And then there's kind of this moment of tension when it flops from one thing into two things. That is the technical scientific term in case you're wondering. Both of those things perfectly formed and functioning. The interpretation being, don't be surprised if God is calling you to do something in a way that is counter to what you'd expect and counter to what you've seen before. And so just like we did 10 years ago, Emma and I, along with our fantastic leaders team, started to pray, Lord, when would you like us to do this? When would you like us to step into becoming a multi-site church and launch a new expression? To step out in faith to what we feel like you're calling us towards. And so after a time of prayer and discernment, we all agreed that we felt that God said to put 18 months on the clock and to aim for Easter 2026. To step out in faith towards the thing that we felt God had said, trusting that he would provide everything that we need at the right moment along the way. To prepare like that cell for the moment of multiplication. Which leads us to today. Welcome. Easter 2026 is like next week. It's not. But it leads us to our exciting announcement, which if you've been paying attention for the last 10 minutes, you could tell me at this stage, right? But just in case you did fall asleep, I'm just going to say it really clearly so that you can share. Here we go. We believe that the time has come. The moment has arrived for us to step out in faith towards what God has been inviting us as a church into for years. And so at Easter 2026, we're going to launch a new expression of Gloucester Vineyard Church in this very city. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, you should cheer. Yeah. Yeah. For the last 12 months as a team, we have been squirreling away in the background, kind of making plans, doing our research, having knotty conversations with our trustees, seeking wisdom from our advisors and our overseers within the vineyard, and seeking wisdom from people who've done this before. Basically getting ready to do what we believe God's calling us to. And today we're going public, so to speak, because we want to share this with all of you as a community. And we want to invite us all to be joining in, to pick up the vision and to step up into our part to play in what God is calling this community into. And so as Daniel said, next Easter, Sunday the 5th of April 2026, we will be launching a new expression of Gloucester Vineyard Church in the north of Gloucester in the mornings. There you go. Two more bits of detail for you. We're currently exploring the specifics of where, but we are heading north for a few reasons, the most compelling of which for us is that the north of Gloucester is expanding significantly and many of the new neighborhoods and areas simply have no church presence in them at all. And as we've said before, we don't think that's okay. To begin with, there will be a very small group of people, eight to 10 people, who will go and who will launch this new expression as a team and build community from scratch. Sunday gatherings will be a simplified, stripped back version of these gatherings. We'll play games, we'll worship, we'll open the Bible and we'll pray together. And we'll be expressing ourselves authentically based on the reality that there will be very few people initially. In the early days, there will be activities for any new kids that show up with their families, but we won't be running a full kids church in the way that we do here at first. The team will also be looking to do local super Sundays, gathering events, maybe an alpha course or two, getting invested in and getting involved in the local community, just like we did seven years ago with this one. Daniel and I will be leading this north team, so we will be at the morning gatherings each week getting things established. But it's worth making it very clear that we will also be present in the afternoons here in the centre as well. We plan to be here just as often as we are at the moment. We'll be preaching, leading worship and serving on teams just as we currently do. Okay, so let's talk a little bit about leadership for a second because this is actually one of the things that I'm really excited about as we go down this path. Another path that we really feel like God has been calling us towards over the last couple of years is to explore the idea of kind of leaning into team leadership in a big way, to try to be a church which is generous and collaborative in our leadership style. Rather than having one or two people who hold all the power and make all of the decisions, instead to be much more equipping and releasing and inviting to have teams of leaders who make decisions together. Now to an extent, this actually hasn't been what's been demonstrated to us or modelled to us in the past, but we feel compelled that this is what God has for our church in the future. And so a big part of what we're doing in becoming a multi-site church and what we're announcing today is a kind of significant step towards that collaborative and generous style of leadership that we feel God is inviting us into. And this really informs a lot of the how when we say how the dickens are we going to do this? The plan is to, that each site, the centre and in the north will be led by a team rather than a\n\nEmily and I, as Emily said, we're going to be leading the team that launches the new expression in the north. In the short term, we will be the site pastors up there. But we intend to hand over to site pastors in the north, basically, as soon as we can. But it's worth clarifying that Emily and my main role will be as overall senior pastors of Gloucester Vineyard Church. Our role will be leading and overseeing both sites. And so, naturally, we will also be establishing site pastors and site teams here in the centre at St John's as well. These will be the people who will take on this central expression with all the exciting momentum that we have here in the city and who will be leading the team to continue bringing hope and joy to the city centre. And so... Would you like to know who it is? Without further ado, we would like to announce that the central site pastors for Gloucester Vineyard Church will be Chez and Don Vincent. Can we get a... Do you want to stand up for a second? Get on your feet. Stand up, you two. Stand up. Hooray. Yeah, exactly. Chez and Don have agreed to lead the team who will be overseeing everything that happens here and we are absolutely delighted. We just want to take a minute to honour you guys. I'll let you sit down so you're not totally embarrassed. We just want to take a minute to honour these guys as they step up. We asked Chez and Don to consider this role for many reasons. Firstly, because we see so much of our church values and our DNA expressed in the way that they live, the way that they run their home. They are joyful, generous people who love Jesus, have a heart for his kingdom and his mission and who live their faith out loud in public. Secondly, they're people who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty. They're hard workers, they're servant-hearted and they're servant leaders, all of which we really value as a church. And lastly, they love this church. They love all of us and they love afternoon church. When we said we were going to the morning, Chez was like, what? Why on earth would anyone go to church in the morning? That's ridiculous. Afternoon church is the best. Yes, exactly. And so we are really chuffed that Chez and Don have said yes to taking the lead here in the centre and we're really excited to see what they and the central team will be doing for Jesus and for his kingdom. We're going to be formally commissioning them in January 2026, but for now, let's just give them another cheer. One thing that it's worth saying is if you're in church leadership or you're moving into it, you need loads of prayer and loads of encouragement. So every time you pray, pray for Chez and Don. Every time you get a picture or a slight word of encouragement, text them, message them, tell them on a Sunday because it's a spiritual battle. I'm not going to lie. And so this is a moment where actually they need as much prayer and love and support as they can. So, got you. So those are some of the details about what's happening where and when. And naturally, we may have a whole host of questions. We're going to answer some today and there's various opportunities to be asking more in the coming weeks. But for now, one of my questions to you, Daniel, can you see how natural this is going to be, is how is this going to change things around here in the centre? How will the launching of the new expression in the north change things? How's it going to affect the centre? Thank you for asking. For starters, so we are working very, very hard to try and launch this new site in such a way that actually week on week, this room doesn't feel very different at all. It might be that there's a handful fewer people initially, but our hope here is that actually things in the centre won't change very much. Chez and Don will be a little bit more visible than Emily and I and will be making a whole load of local decisions, which we're really excited about. But we will still be very involved in the day to day running of the church. Wonderful. So how do I know if I'm going to stay in the centre in the afternoons or if I'm going to go and be part of the team launching in the north? What a great and insightful question. Thanks. So for now, let me just simply say this. Unless we feel a real and definite invitation from God to come and get stuck in in the north, then please stay here in the centre. One of the funny things about the plan that we've created is it's actually quite contingent on lots of people staying here and carrying on as usual. Launching the new expression is going to take quite a lot of hard work and intentionality. Those of us who go will likely, for the first six months or so, we're going to be on team every single Sunday, and there's probably going to be at least one week, one night of the week every single week building community up there. There will be many weeks where there just won't be very many people in the room, and that can be a little bit awkward, and we're just going to roll with that. Now, whilst some of us, we might be like, yes, sign me up, I'm very excited about that, I'm aware that most of us just simply aren't up for that, and that's okay. The reality is, as we all know, there is loads of really exciting kingdom stuff that's happening right here, right now in the city centre. We are not taking our eyes off that, not one bit. What we really need is for this congregation to stay and to stay well, to reach out like never before. Remaining in the centre is not a secondary, less exciting option. Ches and Don and the team are going to be moving forward, and they're going to need all of us here in the centre to play our part in any way that they can. Amen. But Emily, let me ask you a not scripted question in the slightest. Please. Everybody in this room is fantastic. Will I ever see those who go to the north ever again? No. Obviously not. No. But that is a genuinely insightful and thoughtful question that many of us may be feeling, and the reality is that there is a bit of a cost to this, that we will have to pay as a community as we step into multiplication. We're going to have to think outside of Sunday gatherings alone for our friendships and our community to form and to continue. We've seen this happen over and over again with our home groups over the years. Who here has been part of a home group that has multiplied, changed shape, changed days, or changed venues? Yes, many, many, many of us. And it will be the same again. With any change, particularly in a multiply-y kind of way, it causes us to be thoughtful with our time, our energy, and our resource again. Often, we might have to think about how we relate to each other. We might have to find creative ways to ensure that we don't lose relationships with the people that we love. But church is more than Sunday gatherings, right? So, if you haven't already, swap numbers, go out for coffee, eat together, pray together outside of Sundays, encourage each other in the kingdom stuff that is happening, because it's entirely up to us if we see people outside of Sundays again. Are we becoming two churches? We are not. It is really important to emphasize at this moment as well that we are not becoming two separate churches. We are still one church with one vision, with one set of values, one set of trustees, one bank account, one set of senior pastors, and so there will be plenty of stuff that will happen as one church together. Home groups will be shared across the sites. Go to whichever one suits you on the best day or in the best location for you. Youth home group is included in that, so that will be across both sites. Youth from both sites will go to home group together. Home group leaders' training will continue to be across the sites. Our ministries like Chai and Chat, Vibes, Grow Baby will be supported and championed across both sites. But on top of that, there will also be kind of intermittent get-togethers that we will inevitably do, where both sites will get together and have a moment of connection. Think, for example, church weekend away. Thanks. Prompting a whoop every time, thank you. Our approach to answering the question about, like, is that a north thing, a central thing, or like a combined thing, is to ask actually instead, what will be most effective for the kingdom and most simple for the community? So if there's something that is more effective, simpler, and sustainable to stay within each expression, we'll do that. If there's something that would be more effective, simple, and sustainable to be done combined, we will do that. There's many, many more questions that people may have about this, some of which we know the answers to, some of which we don't, and they will come in due course. But we have created a couple of ways to accommodate some of your questions. Firstly, we have\n\ncreated a nifty little booklet. Ooh, fancy. We're like a proper church and everything. In here, we've basically talked, there's a lot of information about what we've talked about today, plus some more details and kind of other detailed questions in there as well. So we will put these at the back at the end. So please feel free to take one per household, preferably. Have a little read, have a reflect, have a peruse and get back to us. So hopefully this will answer some of your questions. Secondly, we have created a couple of opportunities in the coming weeks where we will have a Q&A session. So as we said earlier, next week at Supercharged Sunday, Daniel and I will be leading a workshop Q&A session in here. So if you have any, bring your questions, ask your things and we'll have a good discussion. Equally, there'll be a Monday evening in October where we will have a Zoom meeting for anyone with more questions as well. So watch out in the weekly email, there will be time to ask all of those. Please bring along your thoughts, ask your questions, share your feelings. We want to hear them. Yes, we do. Can I bring our time together to close with some real blunt honesty? Is this okay? Still an okay place to be really blunt and honest? Yeah? Yes. You're like, no, I don't like the sound of that. Please sugarcoat everything. No, I won't. Let's address the elephant in the room, shall we? Making the change to being a multi-site church is a risk. When we do this, it is going to be costly and we are going to feel it. It's going to cost us time and energy and money. It's going to be a risk. So why are we doing this? Why are we doing this? Hopefully you've got half an answer. Hopefully I've got some answers here on this piece of paper. I'd like to give you three reasons why we're doing this. The first and most important one is that we think that God has asked us to do this. This is not a knee-jerk, flippant, glib, I think I heard God speak last week, so we're just going to risk it all on a roll of the dice. We have been sensing that God has been saying this for most of the time that we have existed as a church. And since we started this process 12 months ago, we have been repeatedly seeking wise counsel. We've gone back to God. We've done everything we can to be as sure as we can that we are moving slowly and carefully with as much confidence as we can to what God has for us next. We believe that God has told us to do this, and that is the biggest reason. The second reason is that this is part of our vineyard DNA. We are part of a larger movement of churches across the UK and around the world called the Vineyard Movement. There are thousands of vineyard churches currently in existence because this is what we do. Church multiplication is part of our heritage. It's part of what it means to be a vineyard church. We are here, we exist as a church because Aylesbury Vineyard launched Gloucester Vineyard. Aylesbury Vineyard was launched by Riverside Vineyard. Riverside Vineyard was launched by Southwest London Vineyard. You get the point. As vineyard churches, this is what we do. We spread out. We create communities. This is part of our heritage. This is part of our DNA. The third and final reason, and the reason why the vineyard is so obsessed with launching new worshiping communities, is because establishing new worshiping communities has been shown to be the best, most effective evangelism strategy that there is. As a church, we want to see the kingdom of God advancing. We want to see new people coming into the kingdom, encountering Jesus for the first time, being healed and restored, and giving their allegiance to him. We want to see people joining in the revolutionary family of God, learning to know him as their father, and learning to walk in Jesus' footsteps. And we know that establishing new worshiping communities where there currently are none is the most effective way of seeing that happen. It's been the strategy for the last 2,000 years, so really, this is nothing new. And so, whilst we agree, this plan is a risk, that it's going to be costly and difficult for us as a church, we are confident that this is what God is inviting us into in the coming years. We are convicted that this is what churches, not just ours, should be doing, because it's what the church has done for generations. And we are convinced that if we're serious about seeing the kingdom of God advancing in the county, this is how we go about seeing it. And so, as we wrap up, I just want to recall the stuff of September that we've been looking at as a community. As we've explored church, the church, this church, being a devoted, active, Jesus-shaped community, gathered together, grounding ourselves in good theology, growing in our discipleship to Jesus, and going into the world to proclaim the good news of the kingdom in any way that we can. This is a moment for us as Gloucester Vineyard Church to turn up the heat of what it means to be this community in this place at this time. To ensure that the church doesn't fade into the background, but actually steps up into the fore. This is not something that a handful of the leaders team are going to be doing. It involves all of us to step up, step in, and to play our part, because that is what church is. It is the body of Christ together. It's not a hobby or a spectator sport. It's an alive, transformative community, seeking the king and the kingdom in all things. And so, the kids will come back in at some point in the next few minutes. No, they won't. I told her to keep them. Okay. We've got loads of time. Fine. Heather has your children. It's all fine. In which case, we're going to take a minute to respond. Kiri and Katie and Charlotte, would you mind coming up? We're actually going to sing a song together. It's one that we've been singing a bit over the summer. And we feel like it's one that we want to sing together as a community, particularly in this moment, where we have prayed our prayers and we've made our plans. But we want to welcome Holy Spirit to come, because if God's not in it, we're not interested. We feel like this is what God is calling us to. But we want to take a moment to surrender all that we have spoken about today, all of our thoughts and feelings that we might have off the back of today, and give them back to Jesus for him to do what he wants with his church. Does that sound good? So if you are able to and willing, then please do stand. We're going to sing together, and then we'll go into communion. I'll leave that."

    "transcript": "And so this is the first Sunday of the month. So today, today is Super Sunday. It's so exciting. What the heck is a Super Sunday? A Super Sunday is the moment when we pause our usual rhythms of opening the Bible together and singing songs in order to go out and love and serve our neighbours in practical ways. It's our way of learning about God's heart for those people who are outside of our church. So that's what we generally do every Super Sunday. But at the moment we're in the middle of adding a little extra sauce to these moments of serving. Because as a church we are preparing to launch another expression of this church in the north of the city next year. And so we are using these gatherings as a moment to dig deeper, to do some training, to do some equipping and getting ready for this exciting moment of multiplication. Hooray! And so just to let you know what we're going to do today. Actually I'll tell you that in a minute. Some practical things first. If you want a cup of tea or coffee they're all at the back. Help yourself at any time. If you need the toilet they're just through there and on the left. And that's a fire escape and that's a fire escape. We're not expecting a fire but if there is one head for one of those places. But why are we doing this today? Why are we doing this? Why are we not doing what every other church in the city has done today? Why do we shake things up once a month? There's a whole load of reasons why but one of the reasons that's been really on my mind recently is because as a community of Jesus we are called to be witnesses to the way of Jesus and the kingdom of God and the way that Jesus has changed our lives. We are called to be witnesses. And I've had that little word witness running through my head in the last few weeks because some of us might be aware there was a very high profile assassination recently in the news. A guy called Charlie Kirk was murdered over in the States which was very attention grabbing and a lot of social media, at least my social media, was talking about Charlie as a martyr. Anybody else hear that? That word martyr? So that word was getting knocked around social media which kind of caught my attention as you can imagine. Now that word martyr in English has a very specific meaning. It means somebody who dies for their faith. Somebody who dies for a cause. But the word martyr is actually a Bible word. It comes directly out of our Bibles. And it doesn't mean somebody who dies for a cause. What it means is somebody who stands up for what is true and is a witness to the truth. So somebody who speaks about and demonstrates what they've found to be true. And we find this word martyr all throughout one of the books of the Bible called Acts. And our Bibles translate this word as witness. Jesus says, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you and you will be my witnesses, my martyrs, telling people about me everywhere you go. So we are all, if we identify as followers of Jesus, called to be martyrs, called to be witnesses. We're all called to be witnesses for Jesus, showing and telling the good news of the kingdom of God here today. And so that is what today is all about. That is why we do Super Sundays. It's about showing and demonstrating God's love in practical, servant-hearted ways to our city. I'm personally pleased that today, when there's been people out on the streets of this fair city who have been protesting the presence of asylum seekers in our city, that today we are also going to be hitting the streets in a posture to serve and love and to care and to demonstrate a heavenly kingdom where love, generosity and self-sacrifice are the guiding principles. Amen? Two-minute preach. Look at that. Sorry, just had that one on my heart. There we go. And so today we are going to be demonstrating God's love. We're going to be serving in a handful of ways. There are three things that we're going to do today. Smashing. Okay, I'm going to use this, not because it's necessary, but because we're recording this, obviously, so folks can listen in afterwards. So I'm also going to pass it to you guys if you have got a question. So do be brave and use the microphone. Thanks for coming and hopefully coming with some questions. We're going to do our best to respond to those questions. If we have, hopefully we have something close to an approximation of an answer, we will certainly try to give a response. But don't be at all surprised if we say something like, I don't know. That's a really good question. I'm not quite sure. And so, yes, I wanted to just say a couple of things before we dive straight in. We've thought of a few things to say in case you guys literally have nothing to ask, but I imagine that's not the case. A couple of things to say. An encouragement to please ask all of your questions. If you have a list, that's fine. You may bring all of them. Don't be shy. Please ask silly questions as well. You might be thinking, this seems trivial, this seems silly. Please don't think that. If you've thought of it, there's a good chance that somebody else has thought of it. So you vocalizing it will be helpful for someone else. Please ask awkward questions. Don't not ask a question because you think it might make us feel uncomfortable. We're quite able to defend ourselves. And so if we feel like a question is impertinent, we will say, I have literally no idea. We'll say that's absolutely none of your business, but thanks for asking the question. But honestly, please ask any difficult, awkward questions that you have. But, you know, obviously forgive us if we end up saying, I have absolutely no idea. And also, this would be a great moment to share any ideas and suggestions that you might have. Because so far we've had a number of brains on this idea and on this project. But we all have the Holy Spirit within us. The Holy Spirit speaks through each of us. And so it might well be that you can bring some insight today on something that we have not thought about or to an issue that we're struggling with. So if you've got some ideas, please put your hand up, grab the microphone. We'd love to hear from you. This is one of the joys about kind of going public with this idea is that we get to be collaborative. We get to work together. And now this is something that we are all doing together. Anything you want to add? Nope. Great. Anybody got, who wants to ask a question? There's one on the board. Oh, should we tackle the one on the board? So the question on the board is, will it have a kids' church? Which is a really great question. And I think the short answer to that is yes, kind of. So what we are trying to do is set things up in the north in such a way that on the first Sunday, if there are some young families that join us, we are ready for that eventuality. So what that will probably look like is Heather and one other will be ready at the morning gathering with some activities for the small kids. They will take the kids out and they will do the activity with the kids and bring them back in again. So there will be some form of kids' church, but it won't look like the kind of all singing, all dancing kids' church that we have here in the afternoon. I think one of the things that we would like to encourage folks is that if your kids are currently invested in kids' church, then it would be great for them to remain invested in kids' church. They're very welcome in the center. Because in the north, there will just be fewer kids initially, and we just don't know what that's going to look like. So if your kids are invested there, then great. When we started this church, it looked like having for some younger kiddos, having play mats and stuff at the back so there's a space for parents with small, non-kids aged children, and we'll probably do something similar as well. We'll accommodate a bit for the kids that are there, and then we'll grow as the kids grow, and we will flex according to that. Yes. What venue were you thinking of? Good question, thank you. So we have been, we've kind of been cryptically saying north of Gloucester, but we're kind of looking at kind of Churchdown, Innsworth, Longford, down Hatherley type neighborhoods. And we have been looking at venues for the last couple of months, and we are having an interesting experience of that. So our friends from Cardiff Vineyard, one of the pieces of advice that they gave us was that actually securing a venue is a really important thing to get kind of in place. And that was a surprise to me. I thought it would be get your teams in place, train everybody up, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, get your trustees, get your budgets. Yes, that is very important, but they basically said as soon as you can get a venue, secure, do it. Because what they've done in the past, and where they've, I think they have four sites now, and what they found in the past is they've been completely ready to go, everything ready, but they've got no venue. And when they've gone to the places that they assumed would say yes to them, everyone said no. And they've had a big problem. And so we've been to a handful of venues, and we've been just at the moment of inquiring about how much does it cost, can we get it booked? And they've said, oh, I'm sorry, somebody's just jumped in ahead of you and booked it now. And so we don't currently have a venue. We had a couple that we were really focused on and really quite excited about. But so far, just as\n\nI have a double question. The first one is, how do you guys feel like you're going to allocate your time for both churches? Will you guys be visiting both? And also what time will the second service be? And then the next question is, what mistakes did you make the first time in trying to get people in this church that you won't make the second time to make sure that when you publicize, there will be people in there? And then also, how can we help as a community to get that word out? Such great questions. So first question was, how will we be splitting our time or allocating our time? And the answer is, Daniel and I, us two individuals, we will be at everything all the time, pretty much. So we will lead the team in the north for the time being until we are able to appoint site pastors who will lead the team on our behalf, as Chaz and Don will be doing in the centre. But we are very much going to be here in the afternoons serving on teams, preaching, leading worship, all of that as well. We're not expecting our kids to do both, just in case anyone's concerned about our kids, but we are. And so our kids will be coming here in the afternoon. And the morning will probably be the holy time of 10.30, likely, but TBC, unknown. Yeah. Yeah, so one of the things that we as a family are going to be doing is that we are, because obviously that's a very long day on a Sunday, and so a lot of people have kind of gone, you can't do double church Sunday. And my response to that is, I think you can, as long as you accommodate it in the rest of your boundaries. So one of the things that we're going to be doing and one of the ways that we're budgeting is that Emily and I will basically have Fridays and Saturdays off every week. And so Sundays, yes, will be a very busy day for us. But I also like to encourage folks to remember that as much as this is our passion and our love and our vocation, it is also our jobs. And all of you guys know what it's like to have a busy day at work. Sometimes there's one day of the week that is particularly busy. And so for us, that will be a busy day at work. Is that fair to say? Yeah, I think so. When we have appointed site pastors north and site pastors central, we will be overseeing both. And so that may look slightly different then, but we anticipate being most of the time at both places. The next question was, what mistakes did you make first time that you're not going to make second time? Well, I was going to say, I can't promise we're not going to make them again because we're human. So we endeavor to learn lessons from our mistakes, but also from everyone else's mistakes. We love learning the lessons. I'm going to pause for a minute because nothing is immediately springing to mind, but I'm sure it is for you because that's how your brain is wired. So mistakes that we made the first time that we're going to try not to repeat this time. One of them I would say is, you've got one already, haven't you? When we first started the church, I was very keen, very gung-ho about making the church bigger. I thought as long as the church can be bigger, everything will work. And so we tried to do lots and lots of things to make the church bigger. And we learned pretty quickly that that was a fantastic way of completely wasting your energy. Basically, we learned that it is God who, Jesus grows the church, that he sends people, the right people at the right time when we're ready for them. And really, all of our efforts trying to just put bums on seats was just wearing us out. And not the point. And not the point, just not the point. And so one of the lessons that I hope we've learned is to say, thank you, Jesus, for the people who are currently in the room. And Jesus, when we're ready, we trust that you will send any more that you would like to. So one of the things that we will not be doing is trying to force anything and make sure that there's more people in the room than there needs to be. Another thing is we're better at communication now than we used to be. Things are a bit slower. Things are a bit more thorough now. In the early days of planting church, it looked very different. So circumstances that were presented to us seven or eight years ago would look very different if the same thing presented itself now, simply because it was basically just the two of us eight years ago. And now that's just not the case. And so we have opted in for slower, more collaborative, more communicative leadership because we have discovered through mistakes that that is much better. And we make healthier decisions and people are cared for better. Whereas in the early days, we could just be like, text the five people and be like, we're actually changing to 10.30 rather than 10. See you later on Sunday. And that was kind of it. So there's a lot that has morphed and changed out of necessity because we're leading something totally different to what it was seven or eight years ago. But we have learnt from the kind of gung-ho, less communication, speedy decision making. We've learnt that lesson, hopefully, and I'm sure we will learn it again. I think one mistake I think we didn't make, and I'm glad that we didn't make it, and I hope that we don't make it this time, is doing things sustainably based on where we are actually at, not where we feel like we should be. And so one of the things about our Sunday gatherings is that if we didn't have any worship team, we didn't have worship. If we didn't have enough kids team, we didn't have kids. And when we did have enough kids team, it was small based on what we really did have. And so I think what I often see churches doing is kind of stretching people to kind of strive to be somewhere that we're just not and kind of burning people out in the process. I think what I'd rather do is kind of roll with the fact that there's just going to be fewer people in the room, and that just means we can't do everything that we might do here in the centre, but that's okay. So kind of just not pretending to be something that we're not, I think, that's one. It's just reminded me of, we'd just done a whole series personally about eliminating hurry and haste and kind of that kind of anxious presence stuff from our personal lives. And then that Sunday, like our kids were sick and we arrived at church having made all of the coffee at home. And then everything broke. Like we smashed like three coffee jugs in about 20 minutes. And Daniel looked and went, Asda opens at 10, we're meeting in the mornings at this point, Asda opens at 10, it's 5 to 10 now, church starts at half 10. I reckon I could go. And we just went, what are we, no, there's no coffee guys this morning. And so we just went, sorry guys, we smashed all the coffee, there's no coffee this morning. We'll get it for next week. And everyone went, sure. And that was just a moment where we went, oh yeah, that's better. That's a better way of living for everyone. Could you remind me, what was your third question? In terms of publication and getting people in the seats, not to burn you guys out, how can we help as a community to get people down? Yeah, thank you. So we're probably going to kind of start talking about this a lot more publicly in the next few weeks. When we do, it'd be great if you guys could just share that stuff on your social media. But really, I think just thinking about anybody that you might know in the north of the city who might be interested in coming and exploring faith. Very much a priority on people who are not currently part of a church. So what we really don't want to see happening here is that people go, oh, there's a new option open, I'm just going to leave my existing church and come to this new option. We will be trying very hard to kind of turn people around and send them back from whence they came, if that is the case. We're very excited about people kind of being excited about the mission that we're on, about who we are as a community. We're really not about just shuffling the deck of Christians. And so particularly if you are aware of anybody who lives up in the north who might be interested in exploring faith community. I mean, the reality is that as a church, we don't express ourselves that differently to lots of the other churches in the city. But there are a few things which are a bit different and are a bit fresh and are a bit, I hope, innovative and interesting. Like just like the fact that we do this on the first Sunday of every month is just different. And this is refreshing for some people and it is refreshing for their faith. And so we do encounter a lot of people for whom those small differences actually add up to quite a lot. And so if people are exploring faith and looking for a church, it'd be great to encounter them. And I'd say wherever you're based, center or north, be church really well. Just be it really goodly. Like join your home group and commit to it and invite people to it and pray for your friends and pray for your church family and help them move house. And when someone new walks in on a Sunday, welcome them, give them tea, coffee, bring them over to tea and toast. Like that's how it is. Yes, there are like marketing options to get our name out there or whatever. But the reality is this is a community and this is a family. And so the way that\n\nwould we be leaving? As in we would just hand over the centre and go somewhere else? No, absolutely not. So this isn't Daniel and Emily's exit strategy by any stretch. So a couple of years ago we were tired and we were worn out and we were going, okay, what's next? What are we doing? How are we doing this? And we both asked the question independently of God, please can we hand this over because we're tired? And God said to us individually, no. And we went, he said, well, and so it was a genuine moment of going, okay, in which case we need to have a sabbatical in order to come back and lead well and to come back into this next moment of church because we've been in church plant mode for seven years and we're no longer a church plant. We are a stable, existing church and that requires something different from us as leaders and from the community as a whole. And we went, we need to rest up and grow up. And so that's why we chose to have a sabbatical and we were very grateful for that. But no, absolutely not. If we were bigger, we'd probably just have a bigger team launching a new expression or we'd be like, let's, previous Daniel and Emily would be like, we're big enough. Let's just do three plants at the same time, three launches at the same time. Great, we could do that. That's what it, so absolutely not. We are, we love it here. We love GVC. This is our home. So we are sticking around. No, no, no, no. Great question. Yeah, I appreciate the awkward question. Genuinely, thank you. That's very, very awkward. But I echo what Emily said, like for us, this isn't any kind of an exit strategy. I'm personally so excited about just the idea of multi-site church. I just think it's so innovative and interesting and creative and we've seen it be super effective elsewhere and there's elements of it for our church which I think are going to be really kind of supercharged, especially when it comes to the Super Sundays about like little local expressions serving in a neighborhood, invite your neighbors, walk to church. I'm like, that makes so much more sense for kind of how we express ourselves as a community, I think. And so I'm so excited about trying this because I just think it's going to be beautiful. And I wanted to say just another really quick thing off the back of that which is to say that yes, we are leaning into being a multi-site church and we hope that this will be the first new expression that we launch. We'd like to see other expressions as well bubbling up as and when the time is right. But that doesn't mean that we're not also excited about creating new and different types of community as well. And so I'd love to plant a church. Like how cool would it be to plant a church or two, you know? And we're also really excited about creating missional communities. So before we started this conversation, you two were talking about skate parks slash basketball courts, reaching out to people. Like I would describe what you guys were talking about as a missional community, i.e. a community which is inspired by the mission of Jesus, going out and doing good things in the world, absolutely amazing, which is different to a worshipping community which is centered around the worship of Jesus. It's around the mission of Jesus and kind of out in the world. And so we're very excited. So we say every week we're creating communities which bring hope and joy to Gloucestershire. And when we say communities, we don't mean sites. We mean sites and church plants and home groups and ministries and missional communities. If it's people coming together to extend the kingdom, fantastic. Let's do those things. Let's not limit our creativity. Is that a good answer? Yeah? I would just like to say as well, because we could talk about this all day, we love church. I think the more that we have given ourselves to the churchy stuff, the more we're like, oh yeah, this is our thing to do. And we will die with our boots on in whatever form and shape that looks like. So this is our lifestyle. This is who we are and how we function in the world as far as I'm concerned. So yeah. Yes. Is the aim to grow the North site to have similar elements to the central site in terms of firstly what the service looks like and secondly in terms of the outreach elements. So whether that's gardening projects, grow baby, try and chat, et cetera, add to the list. Great. I have some thoughts. Do you want to go? Okay. So one of the things that we have been talking about as we've been thinking and praying and discerning and all of that is exactly that. Are we looking to cookie cutter A to A? And the answer is no, apart from the values. So essentially we are prioritizing our values being what makes us how we are. And the outworking of that may or may not look different in different locations. So in the center, so our values being those four things we spoke about a couple of weeks ago about being a gathered community, being a growing, like from a discipleship point of view, community, being a grounded community in good kingdom theology and being a going, so going out and doing stuff. And so we have been on a windy journey to where we are at the moment. It's looked different at different stages, depending on where we're meeting and who's with us. So like we've done lots more stuff with refugees and asylum seekers in the past because we've had a gaggle within our community. So our desire is to be flexible with the how, but founded on the why? I don't know what the words are. But essentially values, yes. Outworking, we would love it to be individually expressed wherever people are. The reality is it will be a Sunday gathering that we'll be initially starting. So there will be lots of similarities. There will be worship. There will be kids activities. We'll probably play games because Daniel and I will be leading the team at that point. So that's how we roll. And so that's as much, but we would love it to be, I think we're expecting it to be the same rhythm of first Sunday of the month, Super Sunday, and then gatherings. But what they actually do and look like wouldn't necessarily, because it's a different demographic. So what would work in the center based on who comes wouldn't be necessarily appropriate in the north and vice versa. Yes. I'd say that I think this is one of the things that I think I'm most excited about about this process. I might be wrong about this, which is kind of looking at everything that we do as a church, particularly around our Sunday gatherings and asking that really excellent fundamental question of why are we doing this? What are we hoping to achieve by kind of gathering in this way and expressing ourselves in this way? I'm a big believer in the gathered environments. I love those environments. I think they're really important. I think that it's an important open door for people to come in, to come and experience God's goodness and to encounter him in a variety of different ways. And so I'm like, I'm pretty, it's just, I know that not everybody is as enthusiastic about Sunday gathered environments as I am, but I am. And so, but I am excited about the idea of handing this gathering and this congregation over to Chers and Don and the team and saying, okay, well, this is why we play a game every week, because we want to remind ourselves not to take ourselves too seriously. We want to be welcoming of children. We want to do something to just break the ice. We want to be intergenerational. And so if you can achieve those things in a different way that you think would actually be more, you know, a better expression in the center, then go for it. Equally when it comes to the talk, like if the way that we kind of deliver the message every week just isn't working in the north because we're just gathering a different bunch of people, then we, again, take it back to base principles and go, well, why do we open the Bible and speak in this way? And actually we've gathered a group of people that are completely different to the people that we gather in the center. And so we need to be expressing ourselves in different ways. So I'm really excited about kind of going forward kind of values first. And yeah, we'll probably start with what we've got currently because it's what's comfortable and what we know. But I hope that we ask that question as we go of kind of, well, actually, is there a better way we could do this? Is there a more effective way we could do this? And I would like to see these sites as they kind of continue, as they grow and we launch more of them, that each of them looks very different. Like if you imagine a site in Colford and a site in Stroud, like those two expressions would need to look wildly different from one another because those are wildly different neighbourhoods. And so I like the idea of kind of infusing this whole process with creativity and the teams and permission for the teams to be like, go and express yourselves. Like go and gather, go and be Jesus in those neighbourhoods. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I don't know if it's a specific question. It's probably a little bit intangible. But it's more of what you were saying earlier about when there isn't a venue yet and that can impact how your Sunday expression looks and what community is in walking distance from your venue. And so I guess those are things that are\n\nyet to be pinned down. Is that? You're absolutely right. I mean, the reality is we try to pretend, I think, that it's not important, the room that you meet in, but it really is very important. The room that you meet in, where you meet, where it is geographically, how people feel when they walk into it, just communicates so much before we pick up the microphone. And so to a certain extent, we have a list of preferences of what we'd like to find. And in other ways, we're kind of finding that those venues, God is shutting the doors on us. And we're like, oh no. But again, that's fine. That's how we found here. And by being here, God has formed our community in ways that we wouldn't have imagined. And so we're kind of like, okay. So surrendering to that process and going, well, Lord, we're trusting you that there's going to be a big open door here. And we're excited for that. Please help us to walk through it with humility, whatever that looks like. Who's got a question? Yeah. So for somebody exploring faith, how do they know whether to go for Central or Innsworth? I would suggest whichever would be most convenient. So one of the things that we know is that four o'clock on a Sunday afternoon doesn't work for everybody. I found that with my friends when I've invited my friends to church. They've kind of gone, oh, that's a very inconvenient time to be out of the house. And I've kind of bitten my lip a little bit. And so one of the aspects of why we're doing this is to create another option for those who are just doing other things at four o'clock on an afternoon. So generally speaking, if you speak to people in our church, people are like, well, what do you mean? Four o'clock's fine. But you've got to remember there's a kind of self-selection bias going on there because we are the people for whom four o'clock is okay, or we've kind of decided that four o'clock is okay. We've reshuffled things around. But yeah, if somebody is exploring faith and would be interested in exploring faith as part of the church, then we would say, which works for you best? Again, it depends how they're coming to explore faith. If it's relationally, i.e. your neighbor and you are talking, and then you invite them to church, they come to wherever you go. That would make sense, wherever the relational aspect is. If it's a, I think I need to go to church out of nowhere, which we are hearing a lot more of, I'm going to go on the internet, and then they're going to find one that works in a location at a time for them. So that would be self-selection. Any others? Yes, Andrew. You talked about how God influenced your decision to grow the church. Can you just provide some insight of what God told you and what you felt to continue your journey? Absolutely. Were you here last week? Oh, you were in kids' church, weren't you? Have you listened to our podcast? I would love to direct you there because, so last week we tried to answer that as best as we could. So we took people on a journey of, this is where we began 10 years ago in church leadership thoughts. This is how God spoke. These are pictures that we have had, scriptures and stuff that were pertinent to us that we were praying over that led us to plant Gloucester Vineyard Church seven and a half years ago. And then we kind of told the story of how God has been slowly kind of, it feels like, almost threading the needle or like kind of sewing a tapestry or something of like bits from here and bits from here and bits from here to join up to come to where we are at the moment. So my main thing to say would be, have a little listen to our podcast because it should answer that. Equally, we have booklets at the back that have like questions and stuff that tell a bit of the story as well. But do you have anything that you wanted to say specifically to that? Maybe. I mean, I think the idea of kind of churches growing is, it's potential for a bit of minefield for church leaders and for churches in general. I've already shared a bit of our journey around kind of coming and planting this church and being like, we've got to grow this thing as quickly as we possibly can and how God has very mercifully put that to death within us. Thank you, Lord. But there is certainly a truth to which, you know, I believe that healthy things do grow and that if we're doing our job well as a community, if we are inviting people to come and explore faith, if we are being hospitable and welcoming, if we are speaking to culture in a way that is relevant, if we are worshipping Jesus, if we're seeing miracles, if we're seeing signs and wonders, if we're seeing all of those things, like for me, it seems natural that the community would grow because people would want to be part of that. Like we want as the church to be a revolutionary force in the world. We don't want to kind of just be a kind of nice kind of Sunday gathering with some nice people say some nice things. We want to be a revolutionary force. And so what we would like to see is people encountering that revolutionary force, hearing the gospel message, having it resonate with them, they're being healed and restored. Like for me, it's natural that that would grow. And part of that growth is that we do then continue to send people out. I think what the church has done in the past is kind of seen the church as the result. We kind of gather people, we keep them and we build a bigger bowl so we can put more people in the bowl. And that's wonderful. Isn't it great to have a big bowl full of people? The point is to fling people back outwards and say, okay, great. You've caught it. You've got the vision. Go back to your neighborhood where you live and go and be Jesus in that neighborhood. And that's a big part of what we're trying to do is to try and kind of go, wonderful. Fantastic. Phew. Now go and do another amazing thing over there. Yes, Pippa. I would just like to feedback. I appreciate you saying to us, if you don't see the people that you did once see because they've gone to North Church, that's not our fault. Like I appreciate that you kind of acknowledge you're not holding a social for us on a Sunday. And if we have Christian friends, we should actually see them during the week and not just kind of go, oh no, but I see them on Sunday. I don't need to see them the rest of the time. So it kind of, I think it has woken me slightly to like being like, oh, I need to be an active Christian friend as well as being an active Christian, I suppose. Thank you for saying that. Yes, very good. I appreciate you saying that. But I think that that's a really, it's helpful to keep at the fore, particularly when we're launching a new expression because that's how community is built, isn't it? Is by living alongside people and checking in on them and praying with them outside of that once a week. Appreciate, do you know what? We live in the 21st century West and it's very busy and you have to be very productive all the time and there's always a million demands on your time. But maybe that's also something that we need to think about and how we're embracing that in our life as well of being like, actually, what am I prioritizing? How am I prioritizing that? And am I happy with that? So thanks. So I regularly commute through that area on my bike. How would you like me to pray as I cycle by? Oh, fantastic. Lord, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. I think practical things would be to pray for a venue, pray for somewhere for us to gather, would be to pray for the Holy Spirit to be working in the hearts of those who live in that neighborhood who might like to come and explore faith with us. That'd be great for praying for good relationships to be built. Yeah, I was going to say relationships would always be my number one. So with the community and with this term, like a person of peace, i.e. like a person who just seems to unlock things and have a good connection with the neighborhood. Yeah. Wisdom as well. We will always, always say pray for wisdom for us, the team, the neighborhood, et cetera. Just from what you were saying about relationships being the heart of this community building, as you mentioned, Daniel, there are sort of different communities within that north area, I guess. And how does that look trying to create a church base that serves that north area when there's quite distinct communities already within that that maybe aren't naturally crossing over? I don't know much about the sort of social geography of that region, so I don't have any insight to offer in that regard, but I don't know if that's something that you're noticing, you're coming up against and thinking about or plans around that? Yeah, that's a great question. Would you be able to say anything about the kind of demographics? I feel like he's in the room, so why not? Anything you, you don't have to. I can say something if you don't want to. So if we think about a neighborhood like Innsworth, are you thinking about Innsworth in particular? The example you gave of Innsworth versus Churchdown. Yeah, the north site we talked about has been like Longford through Churchdown, which covers that area. So if the suggestion is that there are quite different communities there that aren't naturally coalescing or overlapping, how is that going to come about with a church that serves all of those areas? Great question. Welcome to the\n\npeople from this background and the reality is we're gathered around the person of Jesus. And so practically, what does that look like? I don't know, but people gather around the person of Jesus. And if we're truly following with humble hearts and loving attitudes and openness and generosity, we find ourselves focusing upon the person of Jesus surrounded by people who don't always look like us. And I think that that is an essential part of what church is. And so I don't know how you get, like if there is a big divide, I don't know. But if there is, then surely Jesus is the answer. And that sounds really like nebulous and like, Jesus is the answer. But the reality is that's what I see here and what we will be praying for in the North as well. Yeah, I mean, I love what you said. Great, love that. Good. It's worth just acknowledging that this North site will be in a neighborhood and when we go out and serve, it will primarily land in that neighborhood. But we will be hoping to gather people from all around, whoever wants to join. But yeah, I mean, as we've been looking at kind of Innsworth as a neighborhood and we may end up in Innsworth, we may end up somewhere else, we don't know. But I've been really excited about that challenge actually, because there are so many distinct groups and ethnicities within Innsworth because of the NATO barracks and just the housing and the new housing being built. It's just a super diverse neighborhood. And I just like, I think all churches should be diverse by nature. And so the idea of launching into a new diverse neighborhood, very exciting, I think. Anything else? Anybody else got a burning, burning question? It can be a silly question or awkward question. Tiny question, massive question. You've got one, yeah. Would the recommendation from you guys be to go to just one and be a part of that community? Or if you go to one, have you now signed up for that one for, in your eyes, that's your site. We'd want you to be in that site now every week or could you flip-flop between? That is an exceptionally helpful question, thank you. I would say that if you're asking us what we think would be best, it would be choose a site and invest in it. Stick at it. As has been pointed out, this is something that usually a large church would do, which might be able to kind of accommodate for that margin of folks kind of wafting between one gathering and another of a Sunday, which might, whichever kind of works best on the Sunday. I think if that happens, this whole plan probably won't work. And so what we really, really need to see is the majority of folks staying really well invested in the center. Simply because it takes some critical mass to gather in this venue in the way that we do. And so we would very much encourage everybody in the church to spend some time praying about where would God like me for the next two years, three years, I would say, to be invested. And then once we've kind of come to that conclusion, to stick at it. Yeah, I was just immediately thinking like on a small scale, if we likened it to home groups, we have home groups that meet on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday with it. And so if somebody was to just go to the one that was convenient for the week that they were having, they'd never be invested in a home group and they wouldn't build the community. And that would be really unhelpful for their home group as well. And so choose one, commit, stick. Sometimes you'll be able to make it, sometimes you won't. But choose one and love it well. Or equally, you're not going to be really weird about it. So for like a year's time, you're like, actually, I feel like the Lord's calling me north. We're not going to be like, no, no, you said that you'd stay in the center. How dare you? Yeah, there will be a whole load of transfer paperwork you'll have to do. It'll be very boring. So yeah, no, of course, we're not going to be weird about it. But we would like to encourage everybody to prayerfully consider where the Lord is encouraging them to be. Anybody else? The only other thought that I thought might be helpful today that we'd kind of prepared to say in case all of you were like, I'm here, but I have no questions, which you haven't done, so well done, is to talk about just why we've decided to go north. Would that be an interesting thing to talk about? Well, there is that. That was not a thought. I was going to say, we do live north, but we basically, the question was north or south. And it was very much like both were on the table for a long time. So we would have gone south as well. Yeah, so would that be interesting to talk about or not? You're all very polite. You can shake your heads and say no. You're interested. Okay, so we'll talk very quickly about that. So there wasn't really the time to share this last Sunday just because we were kind of pressed for time. And so we felt like God asked us to make this move. As a leaders team, we agreed that it was the direction we should go in. And so kind of the next kind of logical questions are where are we going to go and do this? And how the dickens are we going to do this? And so really the first question that we asked was, do we feel like God is really, really specifically saying, I want you to go here to this particular neighborhood? And we remembered when we came, we showed a little bit of our story last week. When we came here, we didn't feel like God had said, I want you to go to Gloucester or I want you to go to Glasgow or somewhere like that. Instead, we felt like there was a call to go and start a church. And so for us, the process was about kind of setting a date in the diary and then praying about where, and that bit came next. And so we kind of felt like we were in the same process of saying, okay, Lord, we're going to put a date in the diary and then we're going to pray that where would kind of, you would reveal the where to us. And that has very much been our experience. We didn't feel like God said very clearly, I want you to plant a site in the North. We felt like he said, I want you to plant a site. And so get going on that. Yes. And get going on that and I will kind of reveal the rest to you. And so the kind of process that we went through was, let's look at this from a whole bunch of different angles. Let's ask the question, where are there fewer churches like ours in the city? So like, where is there kind of an opportunity where we could go and express ourselves where there aren't many churches like ours? Another question was, where are there kind of Gloucester Vineyard church people already? So we've talked about kind of building genuine community and it's that much harder to build genuine community if you don't live in the same neighborhood as the people that you're gathering with. The other question we asked about were, where are there kind of unique opportunities? So where there's new houses being built. We spoke to our friends here at the Methodists because we know the person who leads the whole circuit very well and we went to her and said, are there any buildings like how we use St. John's? Could we use another building? And we also asked a question that Alice kind of hinted at there, which was, is there a way we could do this to make our lives easier? Which sounds like the kind of question that you're not really supposed to ask when you're discerning something from God. But the reality is this is going to be hard work. And so if we don't feel like God is specifically saying you must go here, which we would of course say yes to, if there are ways that we could kind of use our intellect, use our logic, use our wisdom and go, is there a way we could actually make this easier and more likely to succeed? Like if we don't feel like God's saying it's here or nowhere else, is there somewhere that we could go that would actually kind of help with the flow of things? And so really having gone through that process, we identified two neighborhoods. One of them was in the North and the other one was in the South, kind of Quedgeley, Kingsway kind of area, two areas that we felt there was kind of a vineyard shaped hole that we felt that we could go and step into. But one of the things that we kind of, we then went through the rest of it and went, well actually at that point there was very few people kind of down in the South. There was a handful but not too many and there was a much more kind of logical grouping of people up in the North. And the second question was about kind of, is there a way that we could do it that would make things easier? And just at that point it was kind of becoming obvious that Em and I would be taking quite a strong lead in the North and we kind of went, well, we live up in the North and so it'd be so much easier for us to kind of step in and do stuff up there if it's in our neighborhood anyway. And so we didn't feel like God had kind of slammed the brakes on any of that. We kind of started to make some movements towards, we met with some of the other church leaders up there, we started praying for the neighborhood and trying to meet people and walking around and we felt like there wasn't any moment where the Lord was like, no, no, no, no, no, it's not the North. And so we've kind of pushed forward gently on that basis. And so personally\n\ntrying something on for a set amount of time and seeing how that feels and seeing the fit like that is a perfectly legitimate way of discerning something is to go okay God has spoken in this way but not in this way so I'm going to try out this and prayerfully try out this and every time I'm thinking and walking through and whatever I'm praying about it and see see what happens see how God speaks through me trying something on for a set amount of time and at the end of it go huh this is what I've learned this is how God has spoken through that so just helpful from a discernment point of view so yeah. Any questions off the back of that? Okay I feel like we've been doing this for a small eternity so let's wrap it up shall we? Do you want to pray for us and then we can pop across the way? God we thank you for your church and we pray your kingdom come and your will be done here on earth in Gloucestershire as it is in heaven and so Holy Spirit would you come and fill our hearts minds bodies and souls with your transformative presence will you guide us will you lead us will you transform us as we step into what we believe you have for us as a community and we pray again your kingdom come and your will be done amen."

    "transcript": "May I speak in the name of God, who is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Amen. Please be seated. When I used to work in the prison service, I came across a man called Michael, and Michael was doing 15 years for a crime he said he did not commit. Now, one thing you learn about when you work in a prison is they're all innocent. They all say they didn't do it. But prison is a place of despair, where there doesn't seem to be any hope and great fear. And Michael was very fearful in prison, and he was 6'4\". And I'm talking width, not height. But he was terrified to be out of his cell, especially in association time, which is when we used to have prisoners mixing with each other. And one of my jobs that I did when I was working in prison security is I had to do what was called a cell spin. In other words, I had to go in and we had to go and check cells for things like contraband, drugs, and weapons. And on this particular day, I had to do a cell spin on Michael's cell. And I went in there and I found that he had loads and loads of these. This is what's called a rosary bead hanging up on his cell window. And I said to Michael, I said, why have you got so many? How many of these have you got anyway? He said, I've got 33. I said, Michael, why have you got 33 rosary beads? Most Christians only need one. Why have you got 33? He said, I've got one for every year that Jesus was here on earth. And I'm beginning to understand that I need to look to the cross for hope. That I need to face my fears, but only by the help of Jesus Christ. See, the cross can mean many things to many people. And if we were back here in the time of Jesus, the idea of Holy Cross Day, which is what we are celebrating today, makes absolutely no sense. The cross was a sign of unspeakable pain and anguish. It was reserved for the worst criminals. No Roman citizen was allowed to be crucified. It was considered that barbaric. In most cases, it would take many hours for someone to die. It was public. It was horrendous. It was excruciating. But we fast forward now to 2025. What does the cross mean to us in our society? Well, it's also become like a fashion symbol. You'll find in the news that people are degrading the cross by not giving it its proper respect and reverence. In some parts of the world, it's illegal to show the cross, like in some Arabic countries. But in order to understand the cross, we have to unlock the Old Testament. And Jesus helps us to do this by referring to the story of Moses, which was in our Gospel reading. See, the Bible is full of links with Jesus, and this story of Moses is one of them. Moses had been leading the Israelites out of Egypt. They were in the desert. It seemed like it was a complete lost cause. And they started to complain to God. They wanted almost the good old days of slavery. Why can't we go back to Egypt? It was way better then. They thought they could be in a better situation than the one that they were in at the moment. How many of that is true for us at this time? So God sent poisonous snakes to bite them. And Moses asked God, he says, God, what do I do? I'm in this really difficult problem. I can't solve this. And God says, make yourself a bronze snake. Fix it onto a pole. And then when people are bitten by the snake, they need to look at it, and then they were cured. Now this might sound really strange. But what we have to understand is the symbolic nature of this story. Firstly, bronze was a material referencing judgment. It was God's righteous judgment on his people who were going away from him. And the snake was a symbol of evil and rebellion against God. You can read that in Genesis. But this is the direct link with Jesus on the cross. But Jesus was taking all the rebellion of our sin on himself in place of the snake on the pole. So we have the cross instead of that. And we need to look to the cross to be saved and have eternal life. And you notice when you come to this church, we've got two depictions of the cross. We've got the cross right above my head with Jesus who is crucified. But also, you'll notice we've got this cross over here behind me where Jesus is not on it. And this is showing that Jesus is alive. The cross was not the end. You might notice sometimes during church that I have to set the chalice up in a certain way. And one of the chalices you'll notice has got a crucifix at the bottom. And that's always meant to face the priest, the person who's presiding. And that's a reminder to people like myself and other people in this church that Jesus died for the clergy as well as everyone else. It's so important to remember. But the cross has always got to be in the center of our church because without the cross there is no hope. And a bit like Michael, we have lots of fears and worries in our life. And some of them are very small and some of them feel absolutely enormous. Now one of the things you've got to realize when you're going through vicar training is it's really, really hard. It's like The Apprentice 2.0. There is so much that's coming at you in terms of essays and the amount of work you have to do. And I remember a couple of years ago I had a really tough placement and I thought there's just no way I can carry on with this, God. This is far too difficult. Send someone else. And I remember sitting outside before I was about to go into a meeting with my supervisors about my progress and I was so worried about this placement report. And I sat on a bench and I cried. And I prayed, God, give me a sign that you can solve this. And when I lifted up my eyes, I honestly saw the biggest cross you have ever seen attached to the building. It definitely wasn't there when I got there, but it was there for me. And I began to realize that I need to focus my life on the cross and think about what Jesus wants for me. Now consequently, the replacement report did not carry as much weight as I thought. And I was allowed to continue my training, hence why I'm wearing a dog collar today. And some of us have got so much fear about telling people about Jesus. But maybe you've got a fear about the future. You don't know what to do next. You have a worry or concern in your life that just seems so big. You're like the people round by Moses. This is just impossible. I can't defeat all the snakes. It's just not doable. But God wants to help you in your fears and concerns today. And God wants to enter the messiness of our lives to help us in our situations. Do you know the phrase that turns up more times in the Bible than any other? It's fear not. I love that. I love that. That God says, don't worry. I can help you, but only if you let me. See, the Bible is absolutely full of people who were terrified and worried and didn't know what to do. You can read about people like Jonah. You can read about Gideon. You can read about Peter, who denied knowing Jesus. But in our gospel reading, Jesus is saying that I have come into the world to save it, not to condemn it. Now we can try every other type of self-help guide out there, but following God is the right way. The thing is, it's a conscious decision every day to want to follow Jesus. It's like going to the gym. It's a choice. It can be hard. It can be really difficult. I think praying can be one of the hardest things, even for someone like myself. So I have here, I have a small little holding cross, as you see here. And I find this is so helpful to hold on to when I'm doing my prayers. Perhaps you should go and get one. You can buy one of these online. They're quite cheap. They're not expensive.\n\nBut it reminds me that this is what my faith is all about. It's all about the cross. It's incredible to think that this instrument of torture is actually a symbol of being able to put all my fears and all my worries to Jesus. And this is why Jesus, I believe, mentioned about Moses. Because he was telling people that no matter how difficult your situation might be, God can be involved with it. Now I believe that there is a spiritual realm as well as a physical one. There is a battle of good versus evil. Hence I always try to look to the cross. Because what I know about Jesus is that his character never changes. But he is alive and he can help you. That is, if you want him to. Amen."

    "transcript": "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. The end of the New Testament lesson. Gasp hold of a life that is really life. What have we thought sometimes about people, you haven't lived, have you? And that's what the church is about in a sense. What is the true life? Because sometimes it seems that people around us, sometimes we ourselves feel we're almost dead. Because what that means is different in different places. In Jerusalem, we have the story about the rich man who tried to live what he regarded as a good life. A rich life. Rich in the monetary sense. What happened to him? Didn't get much chance. He snuffed it before he had a chance to enjoy himself. Somewhere else in the Mediterranean region, I don't know where, Paul is writing to Timothy. And he says that the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. So avoid it. Don't be trapped by senseless and harmful desires. Much the same message, but differently put certainly. An awareness of how easily money can get hold of us. And then in Jerusalem again, Jeremiah. Looks quite different actually, doesn't it? He's told to invest. Not to save. Not to spend. But to invest. Invest in a plot of land. This is with the invaders just over the horizon. What use is that going to be to him? But he goes through the rigmarole. Weighing out the money. Eleven shekels of silver, wasn't it? What's that equivalent to these days? Hundred thousand quid? Something like that for a piece of land? I don't know the figures. It doesn't matter either. But you get what I'm talking about. Somehow he seemed to have got quite a lot of cash. And he spent it or rather invested it in a piece of land that was going to be occupied in a few days' time by an invading force of, what were they, Assyrians? Babylonians? I can't remember. I lose track of all these people that came back and forth. It wasn't going to be much use to him for his lifetime. But he made a point of doing the equivalent of registering it with the land registry. Which in those days consisted of getting an earthenware pot and hiding it somewhere where presumably he told a number of people where to dig it up when it all blown over. That was going to take, well, 70 years of captivity, wasn't it? And another 10 years for the whole thing to happen. In 80 years' time, go and reclaim that land. Because houses and vineyards and fields will be sold and bought again. But not just now. So use what you've got wisely, is the message of Jeremiah. It's rather different from the apparently rather negative way that the man gets condemned for thinking only of his own comfort and taking no notice whatsoever of Lazarus. The beggar at his gate. It wouldn't have cost him very much to feed, to look after a little bit. And just remember how Jeremiah came to know about his cousin. Two ways, basically. One, the word of the Lord came to him and said, your cousin, Shalom, he's going to come to you. Now, I don't know how that sort of experience happens exactly. I know that it's different for different people, certainly. But have you ever thought, I wonder about so-and-so? And then found it happening. Because the cousin actually comes to Jeremiah and says, buy my field at Anatoth, which is Jeremiah's hometown, because you've got the right. Property rights in ancient Israel are fairly complicated. Not as bad as England now, but fairly complicated. But this was the position, that Jeremiah had the right as being a particular relative to purchase this land. He'd had a thought first, given to him by God, yes, but I think he needed confirmation. Because the text actually says, when the cousin arrived, I knew that the Lord had spoken. Now, he had spoken, yes. But Jeremiah knew it because it was beginning to happen. Somehow he had known before. That was God working in him. Sometimes we wouldn't use such language, yes. The word of the Lord came to me. Nonetheless, he speaks on occasions, through circumstances, through our thoughts. Bear that in mind. Anyway, three stories about money. Now, it's too good when you've got three different readings about money to miss the opportunity of giving you a great lecture as treasurer now rather than as preacher. Okay? So I'm going to warn you, if you don't give up much of your personal wealth, you'll die. Be warned. Give it away now. And I can explain how to give it away very easily. I won't bother you with the numbers now, but the bank account's open. You can't have those love of money. It just can't happen. And secondly, of course, the business in Paul talking to Timothy. The love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. So often shortened, quite wrongly, to money is the source of all evil. No, not quite. The love of money is the source of all kinds of evil. And I think we can see so many cases where that's obviously true. So what I'm going to tell you, of course, is that only by making yourself poor can you possibly hope to be a genuinely good person, let alone to be a Christian. Thirdly, of course, I'll tell you that all that you've got that you can invest, all of it, was put into the church, the work that is being done by the PCC and so forth. Not in your house or your family. The church will take care of it. That's the treasure of life, isn't it? I hope that doesn't sound too familiar. There's plenty of caricatures that believe that Christianity is just like that. And too often, I'm afraid, the examples mainly come from the other side of the pond. We haven't found out about what happens in England. It's the way. The church itself is money-grubbing. Yes, we need it. But if that's the only thing that drives us, we've surely detached ourselves from the Word of God. We need to look more deeply than that superficial glance at the things that the Bible says into the Word of God. I mean, it's also been much kinder to ourselves, actually.\n\nSo easily, all the messages of Christianity get portrayed in terms of trying to make you feel guilty. It's not a great deal of point. It doesn't work. It's the wrong thing to do. But if we want to truly follow our Lord and Saviour, what can we learn from what we just heard from the Scriptures? Think again about the letter to Timothy. Do we claim to love God? Or perhaps we claim to want to love God and want to learn how to do it better. That's certainly more like me. I don't know about you. If we love God, we can't let love of something else get in the way. You can't really love both God and money. That's exactly what Jesus says, isn't it? If our real desires are the trappings of wealth, that's no use to us at all. Nor indeed can we claim a place in the Kingdom of Heaven that we've bought. It's the worst of all, I think. Oh yes, I'm a generous contributor to the things of God, therefore I will go to Heaven. No, you won't. Any more than you'll go there because you're trying hard to be good. It's God's grace that gives us a place in Heaven. Not what we give or what we do. So relax about your money. Don't love it, but use it. And think about the rich man in Jesus' story. He was a failure in love. Love for his fellow human being, in this particular instance, Lazarus. He was determined to enjoy his particular self-indulgence. Avoiding such extremism. That's what it is, isn't it? Extremism is a dirty word, but being an extremist about money somehow seems to many people to be more appropriate than being extreme about your religion or about your philosophy of life. Anyway, we can certainly avoid that extremism. Be encouraged that however little you do, in fact, for someone else, however much you share with others, individually or through organisations like the church, or through relief organisations, whoever it is, every little bit matters. But let the love of God come first. And then think about Jeremiah. Investing rather than spending, hoarding or... investing. Doing that because he knew that's what God wanted him to do. He knew it wouldn't be much use to him. It was a bad investment in that sense. But he believed, because he was called. But he didn't actually recognise that call when it started. He had to respond to what was in front of him in a particular way. But he knew already what he had to do. Are you sometimes unsure about what you ought to do? Thinking, maybe I ought to... I don't know what. It may be God calling you. Or that call may come through somebody else who suggests what you could do is... Or would you like to... All sorts of ways in which the call of God genuinely can come to us. I believe that God, in fact, calls us to invest. To invest in his kingdom. The question we ought to ask, of course, is how? In investments, it's reasonable to ask in financial terms, well, what's the best return? Do I get better money from investing in Nationwide than in Lloyd's? Or whatever. You know, the answer very often is much of a muchness to the various things that happen. But that's a question that needs to be asked within the investment we make. What I hope we ask as we invest as Christians is not what gets us the best returns, but what yields the most in building the kingdom of God here on earth. So don't go asking yourself, if I give a bit more, will that mean that the sermons are a bit better? Or the music's more to my taste? But you may ask, if I give a bit more, will more people actually have the opportunity to know Jesus as I know him? Will the community come together more to care for each other? Will people around me be happier, more content with their lives? Is that the sort of return we're looking for by investing in this church? It's a question that the PCC ought to be concerned with, certainly. What are we doing that shows that's worth investing in? And each of us should ask that same question. How can we most invest in the kingdom of God? And each of you has to ask that question of yourself. Maybe he's looking to me for the answer in your particular situation. Or anybody else. Although you may look for advice. But God waits for our response. Be that from James or the PCC, or anybody else that's in a leading position here. Or from us as individuals. Each of us trying and failing sometimes, but so what? To be loving and giving people. Invest what you have with your money, your time, your energy, your prayer. In God's kingdom. What did Jesus say? All the rest will be given you as well. Take hold of that promise. Amen. If it's comfortable for you, may I please invite you to stand and let us affirm our faith in the world."

    "transcript": "I speak in the name of the Lord, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Amen. In the Harry Potter books, the characters are very rarely simply caricatures. Each one grows in complexity as the novels progress, and so we see them in a different light, sometimes influencing the storyline in surprising ways. One of the most endearing of these is Dobby, the house elf, a diminutive creature possessing great magical power, but slave to the malicious Malfoy family, who treat him despicably. Because of his links to the Malfoys, Dobby appears to be antagonistic towards Harry. It later transpires, however, that some of his apparently hostile actions were in fact attempts to protect the boy from death. When Harry tricks the Malfoys into releasing Dobby from servitude, the elf takes his freedom very seriously. He still believes that service is integral to his place in the world, and he continues to work hard for others and for very little reward. He also displays a profound loyalty to Harry and gives up his life to save him, an action that goes beyond the call of service, eventually enabling a decisive defeat of evil. It might help us to understand our gospel reading today if we look at it in context and include the four verses that immediately precede it, which are these. Jesus said to his disciples, Occasions for stumbling are bound to come, but woe to anyone by whom they come. It would be better for you if a millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea than you cause one of these little ones to stumble. Be on your guard. If another disciple sins, you must rebuke the offender, and if there is repentance, you must forgive. And if the same person sins against you seven times a day and turns back to you seven times a day and says, I repent, you must forgive. So take it as a whole, this passage consists of four sayings. The first two, not causing an innocent person to stumble in their search for God, and both rebuking and forgiving the offender are challenging for the disciples, hence their request to Jesus for greater faith. And this is the point at which today's reading starts. Notice that the disciples recognize that they have faith that is dynamic and able to grow. And by asking Jesus to increase it, they also acknowledge that it's not simply a matter of their own strength. Jesus responds by prompting them not to see faith in quantitative terms, rather than requesting more. They must let the small faith they have be open to the power of God, who can work through their lives in ways that defy ordinary human experience. As the passage continues, we move from an encouraging tone to a more threatening tone, and the stories become more complex and destabilizing. We need to be most careful in a society with very different attitudes towards slavery from first century Palestine. So we must be careful how we approach this text. If the question raised is not about how a master treats a slave, but about how the slave understands their role, it might help to remember that Jesus sees himself in a positive light as an obedient servant. We may also find it useful to recall Martin Luther's insight that it is only as we discover ourselves to be dutiful servants of all that we also encounter true freedom. It might also help to understand that regardless of what we do, we cannot do more than is expected of us by God. So basically nothing is achieved by working ourselves into the ground or putting pressures on others. That is not God's will. And we as servants of God take our direction only from him. God owes us nothing and God's blessing comes in the gift of grace. It is not earned by us. So let's get down to the nitty gritty. What exactly is faith? Faith is total dependence on God and a willingness to do his will. Faith is not something we use to put on a show for others. It is complete and humble obedience to God's will. Readiness to do whatever he calls us to do. The amount of faith isn't as important as the right kind of faith. Faith in our all-powerful God. A mustard seed is small, but it is alive and growing. Just like a tiny seed, a small amount of genuine faith in God will take root and grow. Almost invisible at first, like a seed it will begin to spread first under the ground or in our cases from the inside and then visibly. And although each change may be gradual and imperceptible, very soon this faith will have produced major results that will uproot and destroy competing loyalties. The ability to discern God's will will become clearer. So you see, we don't need more faith. A tiny seed of faith is sufficient. It is alive and growing. But like any seed, it needs to be kept warm and watered if it is to develop deep roots. And in our case, as Christians, that will be through prayer and praise and a deep love and passion for our God. That is the message Jesus was trying to get across to his disciples. By prompting them to examine the roots of their faith and their true place in their relationship with God, Jesus reminds them that spiritual health requires awareness of both their own sinfulness and God's unlimited love for them. Through faith, we can do what God desires of us, but never anything more. And as God's servants, we do nothing for which we expect to be rewarded. But when we prioritize our own concerns over obedience to God, that is when we fall into sin. And sin is never a private matter. Sin always has social consequences. There is always an impact on others.\n\nAnd this is a message that is amply illustrated by the storylines in Harry Potter, where even Dobby's misguided earlier attempts to protect the boy causes problems whose after-effects ripple through the plot. For churches who prioritise serving both God and their community, remembering that we are not seeking reward or recognition should help us to clarify our focus. When the disciples request increased faith, Jesus' response sets them free to live with self-knowledge on behalf of those who need their service. This is not heroism. Instead, it requires steady application to our God-given tasks with a love that understands and accepts that its duty is never done. So my message to you today is not to spend time worrying whether you're good enough to be part of the Christian family. For whatever reason you may think you're not, forgive yourself. Forgive yourself. Exchange that worry time for watering time. Water that mustard seed of faith and watch it grow. God will bless you. Amen."

    "transcript": "in the name of God who is Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Amen. Please be seated. So today is Harvest Festival Sunday when we celebrate the harvest. And I was thinking this week that God has provided for us so much. There is so much to be thankful for. And this week in my prayers I've been thanking God for Greggs. I love a Greggs, especially a steak bake. It's brilliant. I had to travel a lot to my theological college in Oxford, training to be a vicar. And I used to stop off at Cheveley Service Station on the M4. And guess what? There was a Greggs provided for me. It was brilliant. There were so many times during my years of training that I thought, oh, not another weekend away. But just the thought, just the thought of that steak bake was all the incentive I needed to keep going. You see, if we're to understand our passage in our gospel, we have to understand the context. And this is one of the best ways I have found to understand scripture. You see, if you read the whole of chapter six of John's gospel, it actually starts off with the story of the feeding of the 5,000. And it is one of only four miracles that are found in all four of the gospels. Which today must show us the importance of why that story is so relevant. So I want you to picture the scene that you're in the time of Israel. You have just returned from the eastern side of Lake Galilee. And you are wondering, like, where Jesus is. You've just seen this enormous miracle of 5,000 men, it says in scripture, who were fed from a boy's packed lunch. It's insane. It's impossible. But you've seen it with your own eyes. In fact, I believe there were more than 5,000 people. Because it says, if you read in John, that there were 5,000 men. So there must have been loads of women and children as well. So we come to the setting of our passage this morning. You're in this town called Capernaum. You've traveled there with a huge crowd. You've found where Jesus is. And you think, right, this is it. We found someone who can provide for my physical needs. We've got someone who's going to overthrow the Romans. It's all going to be sorted. So our passage this morning is part of a longer discourse that Jesus says in the synagogue, the religious place in Capernaum. And it wouldn't have been all different to what we do here on a Sunday. There would have been some verses of scripture. There would have been some songs of praise. There would have been a collection for the running of the synagogue. The only difference is that the women and men would have been separated. Now, I'm not suggesting we try and do that now. But the point is that Jesus was preaching this in a religious building like this morning. But I've always believed that for you to understand about who Jesus was, we've got to understand a bit more about the Old Testament. And in our reading from the book of Deuteronomy, it's all about the story of Moses. And you can imagine that Moses was out in the desert. He's retired, probably in his 80s, and he's got over a million Israelites, according to scholars. And you think, my goodness me, Moses was out there. There was no Domino's. There's no Burger King. There's no Tesco meal deal to be had. He had to totally rely on God for manna from heaven. And so many people ask me today, they say, well, I don't really believe in God. Give us a sign, or I want to see that Jesus is real. Then I'll believe. It says in Psalm 14, the fool in his heart says there is no God. God is showing through the story of the feeding of the 5,000 and through the story of Moses that God does provide for our physical needs. And we're always very quick to ask for our physical needs in our prayers, a bit like me thanking God for a steak bake. But if you want to understand wisdom and you want to understand about God, then I would employ you to start reading something like Proverbs in the Bible, because it's where you get fantastic wisdom. But you can imagine those people sitting in the synagogue thinking, oh, this doesn't make any sense. Jesus, I'm sure you'll come in here and you want to overthrow everything and we're going to make you king by force. And surely that's the answer to our problems. What's all this about the bread of life? That's not what I've come all the way here for. Jesus understood and knew that they were under persecution. He was living through it. He understood what it was like to have the pressures. And the same way Jesus today understands what it's like for us under the pressures of modern life. It's a bit like being at work, isn't it? When you think, I can't deal with another email. I can't deal with another WhatsApp message from a needy friend. I've got so much that's overwhelming me and I don't know what to do. But our passage in John's gospel is about one of the most famous in the Bible, where Jesus states, I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. Jesus is saying to the audience and is saying to us today, I can give you a fulfilled life. It's about having a total reliance on God daily. It's about believing that the power of the Holy Spirit can come into your life and it can change you. And the truth is the Holy Spirit stirs us. It makes us think about things differently. And many people I meet want to see miracles happen, but they don't want to change themselves. Yeah, I'll hear about God. That's great. I want to hear about God. As long as I don't have to change anything. Now I'm not saying God does not care about our physical needs because he does. And the reason why I know that is because it's in the Lord's Prayer. It says, give us today our daily bread. However, if we're only focused on our physical needs, we are missing the point of what Jesus is trying to tell us. Jesus is saying, I can give you a life in the Spirit which is more fulfilled than the physical one. But what we sometimes find is that a lot of us, and me included, we always try to live our spiritual life just on a Sunday only. And there were many people that I asked that say, you know, are you Church of England? So yeah, I'm C of E, yeah. Why are you C Andy, Christmas and Easter? You see, in our life we have three gauges. It's like sitting in a car. But we have a physical gauge, a mental gauge, and a spiritual gauge. And the spiritual is the hardest one to keep filled, as I truly believe we are in spiritual warfare. And that's why it's so important about Holy Communion. It's why we have it here most Sundays. Because what we're acknowledging is that Jesus was fully human and he was fully God. And the most amazing thing about Christianity is that he is alive. And sometimes we will pray a lot and God does not seem to answer. But sometimes when we're praying for something, God will always answer it in a very different way. And I had a lot of respect for my gran. And my gran was a very, very religious woman. And gosh, her prayers were powerful. I was going through the operator. She had the direct line, you know what I mean? If you ask my gran to pray, it got answered. And I can remember sitting with my gran. My grandparents were farmers. And I can remember sitting in the farmhouse as a teenager. I said, gran, I just don't believe that I'm ever going to find anyone to marry. This just ain't going to happen. It's not going to happen. It's all right, I'll pay for God to give me something else. That's fine, I get that. And my gran said, Thomas, I'm going to pray for you to find a wife. But we're going to pray that you find someone who lives south of Watford. And I said to my gran, I said, what is it about south of Watford that I'm going to find a wife? And she said, no, no, I just believe that we're meant to pray for that. Now, if those of you get a chance to meet Roxanne, she'll find she's from South Africa, which is about as far south of Watford as it's possibly to get. And the amazing thing is that my gran died four years before she met Roxanne. Her prayers were answered, but she never got to see it in this life. But I truly believe that she is in paradise and she could see her prayers being answered. The message of this is never underestimate a gran who prays, ever. But I'd encourage you to seek on in prayer. And sometimes it feels like you're not getting\n\nanywhere and you just think, oh, this just isn't happening. But Jesus promises us in our scriptures that I will give you life. I truly believe that God gives you life in abundance. In the same way, strangely, I was in Aldi the other day and I noticed just the sheer variety of bread options. It's like a whole aisle. Jesus wants to give us abundance in our life. But what connects our story most of all, the story between Moses and the story of the feeding of the 5,000, is do you know what? There was so much left over. And you can read about in the story of Moses about how God provided manna every single day and there was just loads left over. You read the story of the feeding of the 5,000, they'd fill up 12 whole baskets. It's insanely the amount that God will bless us. It's more than we could possibly need. I truly believe this morning that Jesus is inviting us to share in a spiritual life. All we have to do is say yes. Amen."

    "transcript": "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Today is Bible Sunday. It's an invitation to look on what first hit me, what we call the basis of so much of our worship. What we read Sunday by Sunday, most of us, the ESV, the Father 12. I'm sure you know that the word Bible doesn't mean a talking back, it means a library. So what? It means a book from the Bible. Written by very many people, intended to be read to different audiences. They're saying audiences, rather than readers, which is very sparse. It's the word Bible. It is not being read privately, but being proclaimed loudly. It's not just studied by people who have it in their hands. And hopefully you can cover something of the enthusiasm that raised that message up to be proclaimed. It's very different from the Bible, it's not just the book. We need to be careful of occupying a lot more space for other books. And yet, we can't change it. Nowadays, if we want to get a message across, what do you do? You don't get on television, I suppose. Or write a blog, but you somehow ensure it goes viral. What I'm trying to say is it's very hard to predict what will go viral and what will stay unread. But in the slightly more than a thousand years the Bible was being put together, there we are, it's a shout. Loudly through the marketplace. Or at the gates. You'll see many references to the gates in the Bible. It's the place, the end of the town where the senior men of the town got together to discuss legal matters. To deal with what was happening in various cases. Or perhaps at the door of the king's palace. I hope you might hear you. It's a bit amusing, isn't it? Or of course, we need to get more organized. We have the opportunity of a congregation that was gathered together. Synagogue. The word synagogue and congregation means actually the same thing, gathering. It was gathering together to worship God. And what better place would it be for proclaiming the word of God to the faithful than where they were gathering already? It would be there and here. That means here. The difficult responsibility of proclaiming the word of all the prophets. Not much predicted of the future. But commentators have always been on the dime. They don't probably have a Bible still. Nor a written book. We have books of the prophets. Lots and lots of them. Either proclaiming to the tribes of Judah, the southern tribe. The two tribes of the left after the Jewish split. Or the ten tribes of Israel. And before, of course, the kingdom was established. All people spoke the word of God to the people. And that can't have been an easy, persuading, difficult day in the midst of a soft and a program. So there were many people proclaiming the word of God. Some of them were genuine. Some were not so genuine. But they did make a living out of it. Except for those who were proclaimed also maybe down. But before the skies. It's got to be a very bad message in the New Testament. But we didn't depend on the written record. The skies. The right. So they would have listened to the prophets that had spoken. And then they would have written down something. And of course, with all these voices, live audiences, they would have piqued themselves an awful lot. And sometimes the Bible would be very repetitive. Other times it seems like different versions of the same thing. Sometimes it's even books. And it's time for those writings to come together. Eventually, in a book, the book of Isaiah. The book of the prophet Isaiah. Well clearly, in Hebrew, that's the image audiences that Isaiah spoke. They wrote something down. And then what they did, they said something like this next time. But in these days, they went on speaking by reading out the son and the truth as well. A few books of the world. Eventually, it finished up with the book we have. It started off in the time of Isaiah. Of the Caesar round, the man of the game. He was around. He takes his mentions very early on in the book of Isaiah. The later books were addressed to people in exile. In Babylon. Long after that. But they were long, the same strand of prophecy. But it started like Isaiah. And so we have four. It tells us so much about history. And it can reach up to us. No one can do anything. But the prophet, one who writes that the Jewish people have preserved and protected the messenger. He didn't stop them in his early act. With tablets and what the nation are. They wrote those few commented on sections. They found those who were wise and followed the original message. The message of the prophets. The message actually of the whole school of prophecy. In his family. And so the main books of the Bible came together relatively. No arguments of course about what to go in and what to stay out. Now a lot of it isn't necessary to write down the law. Now of course it started with people remembering. And then people came across a situation they had to reply. And they thought, how does that work? So they answered that question and wrote it down. And so there develops a great corpus of law. Mixed in of course with the story. The law essentially based on stories. What happened in a similar situation? There were the books of the law. This is the story of Moses. The sending of the law. The time of the kings. It's not the wrong path. Or over the earth. The law and the prophets. That phrase sounds familiar doesn't it? And of course it's that that the Old Testament, the writings. So this is follows of the antiquity.\n\nand dancing. And also, he was very people. Very, very much. Those three things together, they combined. Through that Bible, for Jesus knew, he scolded, and nobody had books like we had in those days. He scolded and painted to him. He read the Hebrew, and commented on it. In the way that the synagogue would comment on it. And he would have commented on it in the language of time. It wasn't the same as in the text. The teachers would have spoken about it. The development of Hebrew. And the Hebrew had been learned quite separately from the language of the normal age. A bit like, I suppose, the English and the Anglo-Saxon. If I don't understand it, it's not that easy. But that's what Jesus was doing. Translating it, explaining it. In the biblical record of the story, he reached his meeting. I'm not saying he must have been busy in those days. My dad would have told us about this all those years ago. We're all descendants from translations. So remember that this Bible Sunday, let us all of us think of all of those who are finding translations in news. For those taken out processed for languages. The benefit of people overseas perhaps. I think languages are much rarer. The Bible in their own language. It's worth saying other languages. Fairly thought about it in work on those translations. And it's the work itself of those translating. The benefit of those in other countries. Without a total grasp of English as their native language. They used to work with our authors. Speaking English all the way. And they're not much deeper understanding of the privilege we take for granted. And here they brought students in our own language. The third part is not about the Old Testament. It's Jewish in Hebrew. It's written out there. The second process may go on to New Testament. Because all the words of Jesus have been translated for us. There's no written record. But in Hebrew or Aramaic. We can't say back in our native tongue. It's all about Jesus. He's our media language. It's all about the words of the author. But the Bible, the New Testament and the Old Testament are again spoken. Probably not so much about the theory. But about the practice of the academic process of the scribes and Paul. If you like perhaps. It might be a bit more spoken. And people are uncomfortable with Jesus. Wanting to know more. Asking one another. Let's go and have something else. About the stories told. About the miracles of Jesus. We talked about it. Some of them wrote bits down. The grandfathers got put together. By people called Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Look at their names. We're not really sure about their identity. We think it was just us as we call. Quite likely it was. He was one of the ones who put them together. Or was he one of the ones who was a scribe? Somebody else put him on the book. Or she put the book back. But he's got to do with the academic process. We don't know. They might have said that. But we got Matthew. We got him. Go back to Jesus. And he revealed himself. He didn't realise. But he went on believing himself. With God's spirit. To the congregations of that day. Whatever the mechanism of how the Bible came to be. Key is your Holy Service. We don't have a guidance for the Holy Service. The reading of the Bible. Hundreds of people involved. In talking about these things. Writing them down. Gathering them together. Separating the truth from the untruth. The made up. Putting together the work that we now know as the Bible. God speaking to us. The Bible. And the Bible. And the Bible. But let's realise that's how many people are involved. Perhaps something much bigger here. Those first stories. Those first prophecies. In the Matt first normal. And that's the joy. There's so many people involved in that process. And you are too. And you. Talking about the stories of Jesus. Or the stories of Moses coming back. And you telling the apostles. Something about the third. What we wrote. The very stories. Even making a difference in your life. And the lives of the human family. Don't miss that. Be relaxed. There are many people involved in that process. Gathering the Bible together. And expressing it in our language with other sometimes. But let's all be aware. The Father in each of us. And finally. Spreading that same word of God. In the world. Amen."
