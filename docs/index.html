          <p><strong>Theme:</strong> The podcast discusses the concept of &#39;Super Sunday&#39;, a monthly event where the church community pauses regular activities to serve their neighbours and demonstrate God&#39;s love in practical ways. This initiative is part of a broader vision to launch a new church expression in the northern part of the city. The speakers emphasise the importance of being witnesses to the truth of Jesus and the kingdom of God, encouraging community involvement and collaboration in serving others. They also reflect on past experiences and lessons learned in church planting, aiming for a sustainable and inclusive approach to growth.</p>

          <p><strong>Theme:</strong> The podcast episode focuses on the identity and values of Gloucester Vineyard Church, exploring what it means to be a community called by God. The leaders discuss four core characteristics that define their church: being gathered, growing, grounded, and going. They emphasise the importance of community, personal and collective growth, a strong foundation in faith, and the call to actively engage with the world. The episode serves as both an introduction for newcomers and a reminder for long-time members about their mission and values.</p>
