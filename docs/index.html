          <p><strong>Theme:</strong> The podcast discusses the concept of &#39;Super Sunday,&#39; a monthly event where the church community pauses traditional worship to engage in practical service to their neighbours. This initiative aims to embody God&#39;s love and prepare for the launch of a new church expression in the northern part of the city. The leaders emphasise the importance of being witnesses to the truth of Jesus and the kingdom of God, encouraging the congregation to actively participate in serving their community. The conversation also touches on the challenges and opportunities of establishing a new church site, highlighting the need for collaboration and adaptability.</p>
