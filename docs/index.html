          <p><strong>Theme:</strong> The podcast explores the theme of true life and the relationship between money and faith. It contrasts the pursuit of wealth with the call to invest in God&#39;s kingdom, emphasising that love for money can lead to spiritual emptiness. Through biblical stories, particularly those of Jeremiah and the rich man, it highlights the importance of generosity, community care, and the need to prioritise love for God over material possessions. Ultimately, it encourages listeners to reflect on how they can invest their resources in ways that build the kingdom of God.</p>
